<p>Dear Mr. Farrell, </p>

<p>Now that you're shopping for a new vehicle, it’s important that you know the value of your trade-in so you can apply it towards the purchase of your new car or truck.</p>

<p>Now that you're shopping for a new vehicle, it’s important that you know the value of your trade-in so you can apply it towards your new car or truck.</p>

<p>While more goes into valuing a used vehicle that we can outline here, did you know that wear and tear usually falls into one of two categories? </p>

<h2>Two Categories of Wear and Tear</h2> 

<h3>Minor</h3>

<p>Small surface dings, scratches or cracks. Tire wear consistent with the mileage. No mechanical or electrical issues.</p>

<h3>Excessive</h3> 

<p>Large dings, scratches or cracks that would be expensive to repair. Major mechanical or electrical issues. Missing parts.</p>

<p>If you only have minor wear and tear, and everything else is in order, then you might be pleasantly surpirsed at the trade-in value you’ll get towards your purchase of a new vehicle. </p>

    <p>Dear Mr. Farrell, </p>

<p>Now that you're shopping for a new vehicle, it’s important that you know the value of your trade-in so you can apply it towards the purchase of your new car or truck.</p>

<p>We have a few tips to maximize the value of your used car, so you can get the most out of it when it's time to trade-up.</p>

<h5>Get it detailed</h5>

<p>A professional detailing service can have a car with minor wear and tear looking almost new. If you're the DIY type, you can tackle this task yourself if you've got the time. 

<h5>Get it serviced</h5>

<p>An oil change, a tire rotation plus all the little ins and outs of routine car maintenance can add up to a more valuable trade-in when it's time to turn in the keys. </p>

<p>Once you've covered the basics, you can use our trade-estimate tool to find the actual residual value of your car.</p> -->

<p>Dear Mr. Farrell,</p>

<p>If you have a car or truck that you want to trade or sell, one factor to keep in mind is your vehicle's residual value—in other words, the "resale value". </p>

<p>Below are the top ten manufacturers who have the highest residual resale value, shown by the percentage of value they are projected to maintain after three years.*</p>

<p><strong>Honda: 52%</strong></p>

<p><strong>Hyundai: 51.2%</strong></p>

<p><strong>Toyota: 51%</strong></p>

<p><strong>Subaru: 50.4%</strong></p>

<p><strong>Mazda: 49.2%</strong></p>

<p><strong>Nissan: 49%</strong></p>

<p><strong>Kia: 48.7%</strong></p>

<p><strong>Volkswagen: 48%</strong></p>

<p><strong>Mitsubishi: 47.8%</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ford: 47%</strong></p>

<p>If you're looking to trade now, you can use our trade estimate tool to get an accurate number and take that first crucial step towards trading up. </p>

<p>Dear Mr. Farrell,</p>

<p>If you have a car or truck that you want to trade or sell a huge factor that you must keep in mind is your vehicle's residual value.</p>

<p> // image of a Honda Civic // </p>

<p>Your Vehicle's Residual Value: 51.64%</p>

<h5>What is Residual Value? </h5>

<p>Residual value is the total value of your car or truck—taking into account overall quality, durability, and brand desirability—calculated as a percentage of the original MSRP. </p>

<p> // example stack // </p>

<p>MSRP: $25,000</p>
<p>Residual Value: 50%</p>
<p>Length of Lease: 36 months</p>

<p>Residual value at the end of the lease: <strong>$12,500 </strong></p>

<p>Whether you're looking to lease, buy, trade or sell, the residual value is a huge factor in the price of a car. </p>
