# TrueCar Writing Style Guide

Imagine a unique and eclectic community—a collision of coders, artists, data nerds and financial wizards.

Now imagine they like cars.

Nice.

We're all some of those, and some of us, all of those; and we've come together to work towards a common goal. But how does such a diverse group communicate with a unified voice? It begins by understanding that there's a TrueCar language, complete with its own rules and nuances. Most notably, be authentic, be approachable and be human.

Sorry Siri.

What you will find here are some useful guides to help you become fluent in that TrueCar language with minimal effort. Enjoy

# **UX & Product**

Good product copywriting is concise, clear and mindful of the many different devices that people use to access the Internet.

Good product copywriting also goes out of its way to not irritate a user.

Few things will annoy a user more than complicated instructions or sprawling sentence structure.

If a user has to think too hard to "get" what you're trying to say, then this creates a usability issue, and the copy needs to be reworded.

In other words: keep it **simple**, keep it **civil** and keep it **short.**

Don't say in 140 characters what you can just as easily say in 50.


## Voice

TrueCar users want reassurance that they are owning the process of using TrueCar. Writing in an active voice empowers the user and adds to TrueCar's authority. Use a steady and consistent tone of voice. Confident but never cocky. Also, writing in active voice means your sentences will often be shorter, clearer and easier to understand—all essential elements of good UX writing. 


        You can find your VIN (17 characters) in two places on your vehicle.


        Your VIN (17 characters) can be located in two places on your vehicle.

Also, don't talk down to a user or cast actions they've taken in a negative light. It's mean.

**For example:** When a user has entered incorrect information into a form


        Looks like there's an error in the VIN field. Go back and correct it to continue.


        You've made an error when providing your VIN. Correct it, or you will not be able to continue.

Try and avoid complicated words or phrases. Product copy should attempt to clarify an action, not make it more obscure.

**For example:** When explaining to a user why they need to enter their VIN to activate TrueCar Trade:


       Write this: Dealers need your VIN to give you an accurate price for your vehicle.


        Entering your Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) ensures that the Dealer will be able to give you accurate pricing information on your vehicle when you reach the Dealership.


## Numbers & Pricing

Our car pricing data is a core value proposition in the TrueCar experience. The way we display pricing—including single prices, averages and ranges—is guided by a few easy-to-follow directives.


<h4>Always write out the price numerically</h4>

You should never need to spell out a price anywhere in the product, it eats up character count and takes a lot longer for a user to comprehend.


        $45,165


        Forty-Five Thousand One Hundred Sixty-Five Dollars


### Dashes

An en dash is used to indicate a range of something in between two items. A great example of this—one that is germane to the TrueCar experience—is a price range:


        $1,000 – $10,000

The Associated Press Style guide allows for a space on either side of an en dash, the Chicago Manual of style does not. Since we're a bunch of happy little anarchists here at TrueCar, we're going to go with the AP directive. It looks cooler.


### Larger numbers

This one seems tricky, but it's not. It does require a small bit of memorization on our part.

When displaying a price that is more than $99,999 but less than or equal to $999,999, write out the entire price numerically.


        $100,000


        $230,000


        $356,239

However, if the large number in question is used to label a UI element, where character efficiency is the most important factor, use the casual abbreviation for thousand—an upper-case "K" with no space between.


        $100K


        $230K


        $356K

If the day ever comes that TrueCar has pricing data on a Koenigsegg CCXR Trevita, which retails for millions of dollars, that would be pretty sweet. Also, we'd follow the rule in regards to those large numbers and write it out like so:


        $4.8 Million


        $4,800,000


## Adverbs

There are times when adverbs are unavoidable. But, more often than not, you can remove them, or a sentence can be re-written to exclude them, without losing the message.


Exclusion example:


        To get your True Cash Offer, find your VIN and click the link below.


        To get your True Cash Offer, simply find your VIN and click the link below.


Rewritten example:


        You can redeem your True Cash Offer by dropping your car off at your local Dealer.


        You can redeem your True Cash Offer by dropping your car off locally at the Dealership.


## Comedy

Our brand strategy can be heavy on the humor. This is a good thing; life is too short to sit through boring advertising.
 
However, when it comes to the product, be selective when and where you introduce humor. A user may return to a screen several times when using TrueCar. What once was clever copy becomes annoying when you read it for the twentieth time. 


## Idioms

Using idioms (common sayings that aren't meant to be taken literally) in product copy can be disorienting to users. Idioms also have the same disadvantage that comedy has: what is clever the first time you read it becomes tiresome when you read it twenty times.


## Jargon

Industry-specific terminology can be intimidating to users who are not familiar with those terms. Whenever possible, try and find common alternatives.

For example: When describing the price that a user receives from a Dealer


        TrueCar Certified Dealers provide you with real prices on actual cars.


        TrueCar Certified Dealers will provide you with transactable offers on in-stock inventory.

If no common alternative exists, be sure to define the term for the user early on.

**For example: When describing what a "VIN" is and why we need it when a user is selling a car through TrueCar.


        Your Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is a 17-digit number that is unique to your specific car or truck. You'll need to enter this for the Dealer to give you an accurate price.


        You must enter your VIN for the Dealer to give you an accurate price.


## Puns

Puns are not universally loved. Avoid introducing puns into the TrueCar product.


## Introductory Phrases

Saying hello is always polite, but once a user is well inside the experience, we can cut to the chase.

Here's one example


        Choose a password to complete your profile.


        The next thing you must do is choose a password to complete your profile.

And here is another


        Enter your VIN to get started


        You must enter your VIN to get started

TrueCar users are pretty savvy. Once they get the hang of the things, they won't need the extra prompting that an introductory sentence provides. Save on character count and let them explore.


## Exclamation Points

Try and be conservative with how you use exclamation points. They can be useful in adding emphasis to a sentence, but an excessive ammount of exclamation points can be desensitizing to a user. When everything is exciting, nothing is exciting.


        There are more incentives available for this vehicle, select all that apply!

There is an [episode of Seinfeld](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSKn8RlD7Is) that illustrates this point, watch it if you have time.


## Points of View


### Second person 

When addressing a user in a personalized experience, we use the pronouns "your" or "yours." This possessive pronoun usage has a dual purpose: It brings a feeling of personalization into the experience, and it introduces a stronger sense of ownership.


        Here is the Price Report for your 2017 Nissan Altima


        Here is the Price Report for a 2017 Nissan Altima

The global exception to this rule is that you may use the first person possessive pronoun "My" as a navigation element when you are trying to describe an element i.e. "My Account."

However, when you are writing descriptive copy to describe this element, never mix "my / mine" with "you / your" as it can cause confusion.


### First person 

TrueCar user experience copy should focus on the benefit to the user. Excessive use of first person pronouns "I" or "We" diminishes this emphasis. TrueCar is seldom "doing" something for the user. The user is discovering things for themselves.


        There are three Dealers with eight offers ready for your review.


        We have found three Dealers with eight offers ready for your review.


# **Brand & Marketing**

"We exist to be the most transparent brand in automotive, to serve as a catalyst that dramatically improves the way people discover, buy and sell cars."

Transparency: to all of us here, it's more than just a word—it's our north star. Which is why everything we communicate should always tether back to this core value. Copy that's too clever or "addy" isn't really us. That doesn't mean it can't be loose or fun. On the contrary, it can be whatever the job calls for. Just remember, our brand is about breaking through the noise that's so often associated with car buying—all the more reason to be friendly, familiar, and honest.


How Does That Sound to You?

A very good rule of thumb is to write like you speak. Imagine you're talking to someone that knows little to nothing about us. Would they understand what you're saying? Would they look at you funny, as if you're trying too hard?


        Instead of:


        "It's the best way to purchase a vehicle."


        Go with:


        "It's a great way to buy a car or truck."

Note: A truck is not a car. Ask a truck driver, they'll tell you.


## Headlines

Always title casing. No periods at the end of the headline (unless it's a two-sentence headline).


        Example 1: A New Way to Buy a Car


        Example 2: A New Way to Buy a Car. A Great Way to Save Money.

['Titlecapitalization.com'](http://titlecapitalization.com/) is your co-pilot, the Chicago Manual of Style is your guide—but only for headlines. For all else, we generally defer to the Associated Press Stylebook.


         We Found Four In-stock Matches for You

We also use title capitalization in button copy, call to action language, navigational hyperlinks and listed items. 



Title case is all about creating a hierarchy of information.

If you find a use case that doesn't fit these examples, ask yourself if you want any of the information you're writing to be at the top of a hierarchy.

If you do want a sentence or list item to be at the top of a hierarchy, then that sentence or list item should be capitalized using title case.


## Subheadlines

Sentence casing. As with headlines, no periods at the end of the subheadline unless it has two sentences.


## Ampersands

We can live without ampersands, with three exceptions: ampersands are acceptable in button, navigation or meta data copy for character efficiency.


## Capitalization

Knowing which words to capitalize and which words not to can be a headache— especially with so many stakeholders involved. In general, use common sense. However, some specific guidelines: Important words like names, organizations, and events should always be capitalized, and always capitalize the customers that drive our business – "Dealers." This applies to "TrueCar Certified Dealers" and "Dealers" who haven't joined our network. Use lower-casing for "dealerships," unless referring to a "TrueCar Certified Dealership."


## Commas

We're selective about how we use the Oxford comma. We try to avoid it.


        I bake cookies that are gluten-free, soy-free, wheat-free and taste-free.

But, sometimes it's necessary. If you read the sentence out loud and need to pause for a breath, chances are it needs a comma.


## Contractions

Contractions make us sound friendly and human!


        "We're"


        instead of


        "We are."


## Telephone Numbers

If the number appears in a designed document, use periods between numbers. If it appears as plain text in an email, use hyphens.


        Design: 800.200.2000


        Email: 800-200-2000


## Time Periods

Use a number with am or pm—without a space. Don't use minutes for on-the-hour time.


        By 4am, I'm up baking gluten-free rocks for lunch. By 11:30pm, I'm finished cooking them.

Use an en dash between times to indicate time passed.


        I binge on CSI: Miami from 11:30pm–4am.


## Date Notation

When writing out a date for casual usage, use the United States notation of month-day-year (M/D/YYYY) and use numerals to represent each. Use forward slashes to separate the month, day and year.


        1/16/1948 is the day that the first generation of the Ford F-150 went on sale.


        This written style guide has been a work in progress since 1/9/2017.

The above format looks nice and saves on character count. However, there is a possibility of confusion when dealing with single digit days in months that are earlier in the year.


        2/9/2018

To know that this notation represents "February 9th, 2018" and not "September 9th, 2018" we would have to assume we are reading the United States formatting of M/D/YYYY.

As TrueCar currently only operates in the U.S., the likelihood that a user will read the date as intended is very high.

But, if we need to write a date that must unquestionably be interpretted as an exact day (such as an expiration date of a incentive), spell out the month and add an ordinal indicator to the day.


        This offer is valid until January 3rd, 2019.


        This incentive expires on September 1st, 2019.


        Hurry in now; the springtime sales event only happens from April 2nd through April 29th, 2018!


## Titles

An employee's title should always be written as name first, title second (spelled out), and if necessary, division or department. The only exception to the "spelled out" rule is for the CEO, VP, SVP, and EVP title.

There's no need to add TrueCar to anyone's title unless his or her name and title are being used in a non-TrueCar branded environment like a press release or an article in a magazine.


        Brian Skutta, EVP, Dealer Sales and Service

When using titles in a non-TrueCar branded medium:


        Landon Manjikian, Marketing Manager, TrueCar


## Company Names & Products

Check companies' official websites to find their preferred conventions.

The first mention of a company or product can be with its name. After that, start finding other ways to describe it. For example once you've said TrueCar the first time, start referring to us as "we" or "our."

# **Proper Nouns**

## Certified Dealers

Simply put, they're our customers and thus what drives our business. We respect their voice and embrace it. So much so that they're often a key source of insight behind what we do. And remember, TrueCar Dealers aren't the only ones who see our work. Other Dealers do too; and ultimately, it's our goal to have them join us.

## TruePrice

A single, market-validated price on a car or truck. The actual price. The total before tax that a person will pay at the dealership in order to drive the vehicle home. Basically, the total before tax. 

## Price Curve


# **SEO**


## How it Works

Writing for search engine optimization is guided by this principle:


        "Every webpage should try to be the authority on one single question or topic."

Every page you write on TrueCar should strive to be the authority on one thing, and one thing only.

Now, we know what you are thinking:** Only one thing? That sounds dumb. Why?**

Good question, and the answer lies in the simplicity of search engine technology. At its core, a search engine is just a big index that stores, sorts and displays webpages when commanded by a user.

The search engine "collects" these webpages using "crawlers," that go from webpage to webpage, storing and cataloging as they go.

Google calls their crawler "Googlebot." Cute, huh?

Once a web page is in a search engine's index, a user can retrieve that page by using search commands or "keywords."

Enter a keyword into the search engine, it'll give you a webpage about that keyword. That "keyword" is your "one-thing" that your copy should be devoted to—contextually speaking.

It can be as broad a topic as "The history of cars" or as laser focused as "how to change the oil on a 1996 Toyota Tacoma." As long as it covers that one topic in detail, and it satisfies a searchers need for information, then you're on the right track.

There are [thousands of blogs](https://www.google.com/search?q=allintitle%3Aseo&rlz=1C5CHFAenUS715US717&oq=allintitle%3Aseo&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.11742j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) about why and how the search engines keep on a' running. For the sake of this guide, we're going to focus on how to write so we don't gum up the gears.


## Keywords

Keywords are user questions, nothing more. A user asks a question of the search engine in the form of a query, and the search engine's algorithm gives the users the smartest answer it can muster—in the form of a webpage.

These questions come in three types:


        **1. Informational:** A user wants to know something about a thing.


        **2. Navigational:** A user wants to find out where a thing is.


        **3. Transactional:** A user wants to buy, get or acquire a thing.


### 1. Informational

a user wants to "know" something about a thing. This is usually a user who is in the high-funnel "research" phase of car-buying. They're just asking questions and kicking the tires. Good folks.


        "How does the 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee handle?"


        "What is the MPG of the 2018 Toyota Prius"


        "What happened to Scion?"


### 2. Navigational:

A user is curious to know where to find something. That "something" may be a Jeep dealership. It may also be the address of a delicious Thai restaurant, or the location of the nearest Bob's Big Boy... food dominates this category of search. People are hungry.


        "Where is the nearest Jeep Dealer?"


        "Jeep dealer near me"


        "Thai food near me with a decent Yelp rating."


### 3. Transactional:

This is a category of search that usually means a user is ready to buy a thing. They've kicked the tires, they've found the local dealers and now they want to get down to brass tax—usually meaning they want the price.


        "2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee Pricing"


        "Lease a 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee"


        "Buy a Jeep Grand Cherokee"


## Keyword Stuffing

Excellent organic visibility through search is essential to TrueCar's success. However, a good user experience is a paramount concern. Never stuff a page with keywords. The search engines no longer reward such behavior, and it makes for a bad user experience.

Just try to write about your topic in a natural way, free-flowing way.


**Example:**

If you were writing content on the topic of "Electronic stability control."


        Electronic stability control (ESC) is a computer-controlled safety feature that works by detecting and reducing vehicle traction loss. If ESC determines that your car is losing traction, the computerized system will help correct the problem by applying the brake to the appropriate wheel at exactly the right time. ESC may also decelerate if necessary. Saving your car, and possibly your life.


        Electronic stability control is a computer controlled electronic stability control safety feature that works by detecting and reducing vehicle traction loss with electronic stability control. If electronic stability control determines that your car is losing traction, electronic stability control will help correct the problem by applying the brake to the appropriate wheel at exactly the right time. Electronic stability control may also decelerate if necessary because it is really good at electronic stability control. Saving your car, and possibly your life. Thank you, electronic stability control.

**Bottom line:** Don't get caught up with the idea of optimal keyword density or keyword useage on the page. Be natural, use your keywords contextually and write like you talk. The search engines, and most importantly the user, will appreciate that.


## Headings

TrueCar uses 5 header tags: h1, h2, h3, h4 and h5. And they go numerically from most important to least important—as far as the search engine cares.

The h1 tag is what you would use as the main title of your page. H1s are usually at the top of the page and are most often, but not always, a bigger font size than other text on the page.


# 
        This is an example of an h1


## 
        This is an example of an h2


### 
        This is an example of an h3


#### 
        This is an example of an h4


##### 
        **This is an example of an h5**

It's because of this prominence and importance that the search engine tends to weigh the h1 tag more heavily than other content on the page.

Be sure to have the keyword you want the page to rank for inside the h1 heading, otherwise you're diminishing that page's SEO potential.


## Meta Descriptions

In short: a meta description is a 160 character "elevator pitch" (or summary) on why a user should click and visit your webpage. They show up under a title tag when a user is searching for a thing and your webpage is one of the results they get back.

The search engine will usually truncate any meta description that is above 160 characters, so you have to make your point clearly and quickly.


        Shop for new & used cars and trucks. Read owner reviews, get a discounted TruePrice from a Certified Dealer and save an average of $3,106 off MSRP with TrueCar.


        Shop for new and used cars, trucks and SUVs. Read real owner reviews, get an upfront and discounted TruePrice from a TrueCar Certified Dealer and save an aver...

The above is an example of the search engine cutting off the meta description and adding ellipses exactly at the 160 character cut-off point. On occasion the search engine will show more than 160 characters, but generally speaking, 160 is the max.

However, if the meta description is not optimized at all, the search engine will sometimes just choose a random snippet from the page content to use as the meta description.

So do your best to optimize the page descriptions to the best of your abilities. Be concise and don't use any unnecessary adjectives, adverbs or punctuation marks. Also make sure that the content of the meta description accurately reflects the content of the page, otherwise the user will bounce.

The most important thing to keep in mind when crafting meta descriptions is to write a compelling, and truthful, summary of why a user should visit TrueCar to find the answer to their question.

Always keep that in mind and you should be in good shape.


## Title Tags

Title tags are webpage labels that live in the "head" section of an html document. They are, arguably, the most important part of a document for SEO—as far as writing goes.

Because a title tag the keyword optimized label for any one given webpage page, it tells the search engines what the page is about.

Each page should have a unique title tag that's relevant to the page's topic.


**Example:**

If you were writing a title tag for the TrueCar homepage.


        Car Prices & Inventory | Savings on New & Used Cars | TrueCar


        "TrueCar.com"

The search engines will usually only show the first 60 or so characters of any given title. So while a title tag could be longer than 60 characters, anything over 60 won't show up in the search engine results page.

If your title goes over the search engine's character limit, it will get cut off by ellipses, and nobody will ever know what you were trying to say.


        Car Prices & Inventory | Savings on New & Used Cars | TrueCar


        "Car Prices and Inventory | Guaranteed Savings on Great New and Used..."

So keep it short, you've got precious real estate to work with. The ampersands is your friend here. Also, don't feel the need to add unnecessary adjectives or adverbs.
