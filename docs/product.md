<h1>How to Write for Product</h1>

Good product copywriting is concise, clear and mindful of the many different devices that people use to access the Internet. Good product copywriting also goes out of its way to not irritate a user. Few things will annoy a user more than complicated instructions or sprawling sentence structure. If a user has to think too hard to "get" what you're trying to say, then this creates a usbability issue, and the copy needs to be reworded. In other words: keep it simple, keep it civil and keep it short. Don't say in 140 characters what you can just as easily say in 50.

# Voice

TrueCar users want reassurance that they are owning the process of using TrueCar. Writing in an active voice empowers the user and adds to TrueCar's authority. Use a steady and consistent tone of voice. Confident but never cocky. Also, don't talk down to a user or cast actions they've taken in a negative light. It's mean.

> You can find your VIN (17 characters) in two places on your vehicle.

> Looks like there's an error in the VIN field. Go back and correct it to continue.

# Phrasing 

Try and avoid complicated words or phrases. Product copy should attempt to clarify an action, not make it more obscure. Never use double entendres. If you're going to use a slang or an obscure parlance, just make sure it's not inadvertently offensive or racist. You may be laughing, but there are a lot of those. When in doubt, Google it. 

# Numbers

Our car pricing data is a core value proposition in the TrueCar experience. The way we display pricing—including single prices, averages and ranges—is guided by a few easy-to-follow directives.

<h4>Always write out the price numerically</h4>

You should never need to spell out a price anywhere in the product, it eats up character count and takes a lot longer for a user to comprehend.

> $45,165

<h4>Use an en dash between price ranges</h4>

An en dash is used to indicate a range of something in between two items. A great example of this—one that is germane to the TrueCar experience—is a price range:

> $1,000 – $10,000
