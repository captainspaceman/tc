<h1>The TruePrice Difference</h1>

<h3>A Better Price</h3>

<p>With TrueCar, a certified dealer gives you an upfront, discounted price that includes all fees, accessory costs, and incentives. This is your TruePrice—the price you’ll pay at the dealership. No questions asked.</p>

<h3>Dealers Compete; You Compare</h3>

<p>TruePrice is better because over 15,000 dealers uniquely set the price in TrueCar knowing you will see their prices alongside what other people paid. They price to get your business. They only have one shot.</p>

<h3>A Price Curve for Every Car</h3>

<p>Every vehicle on TrueCar has a unique price curve that shows you what your neighbors paid for that same car. Cut through the clutter by instantly comparing the TruePrice to what other people paid.</p>
