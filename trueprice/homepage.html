<h1>Get a better price that you will actually pay at the dealership, no questions asked. </h1>

<h3>Right Car, Better Price. </h3>

<p>It’s a question on every car shopper’s mind: “How do I know that the price I see on this car is a good price?” The answer lies in transparency.</p>

<p>With TrueCar, a Certified Dealer gives you an upfront, discounted price that includes all fees, accessory costs and incentives. This is your TruePrice, the price you’ll pay at the dealership. If you shop other sites, you’ll find that the TruePrice is better than what you find elsewhere.</p>

<h3>A Price Curve For Every Car</h3>

<p>TruePrice is better because over 15,000 dealers uniquely set the price in TrueCar knowing you will see their prices alongside what other people paid.</p>

<p>Our dealers know all about the TrueCar Price Curve — they can see it when they set their pricing. Because of the curve, they price their vehicles competitively, so they won't lose your business. They only have one shot.</p>

<h3>Trusted to Deliver the TruePrice</h3>

<p>Since the very beginning, TrueCar has partnered with some of the largest membership organizations in the country, including USAA, Sam’s Club, American Express and Chase, giving members who use TrueCar a superior car-buying experience.</p>
