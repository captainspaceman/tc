We think most sites don't truly care about price, and believe that not disclosing destination fees or shipping charges upfront creates confusion over hidden fees when at the dealership. Why else would many car manufacturer or leading research websites not include destination fee charges in the display of the MSRP until you've indicated that you want to buy that car? For us it's simple: because the destination charge is always found on the window sticker of a new car, and is a fee that generally is not negotiable, TrueCar includes the value in the calculation of the MSRP wherever it is shown as a total. The destination fee for the 2017 Nissan Altima is at least $885, and can vary by region.","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"4ut95","text":"","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"60jpl","text":"Available Manufacturer Incentives, Bonus Cash and Rebates","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[{"offset":0,"length":57,"style":"BOLD"}],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"b82nd","text":"","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"ev6lu","text":"Up to $2,500 in customer cash, bonus incentives and rebates are available for the 2017 Nissan Altima.","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"djva","text":"","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"5r5hb","text":"When available, customer cash and dealer incentives can have a significant impact on a car buyer's ability to negotiate a great deal.
