<h1><br></h1>
<p>Welcome to TrueCar</p>

<p>You're now part of our unique and eclectic community. Imagine a collision of coders, artists, data nerds and financial wizards.</p>

<p>We're all some of those, and some of us, all of those; and we've come together to work towards a common goal. But how does such a diverse group communicate with a unified voice? It begins by understanding there's a TrueCar language, complete with its own rules and nuances. Most notably, be authentic, be approachable, be human.</p>

<p>Sorry Siri.</p>

<p>What you will find here are some useful guides to help you become fluent in that TrueCar language with minimal effort. If you have any follow-up questions after reviewing any of these guides, <a href="mailto:rfarrell@truecar.com?Subject=Hello%20again" target="_top">contact us.</a></p>

<p>"We exist to be <em>the most transparent brand in automotive</em>, to serve as a catalyst that dramatically improves the way people discover, buy and sell cars."</p>

<p><strong>Transparency:</strong> to all of us here, it's more than just a word&mdash;it's our north star. Which is why everything we communicate should always tether back to this core value. Copy that's too clever or &ldquo;addy&rdquo; isn't really us. That doesn't mean it can't be loose or fun. On the contrary, it can be whatever the job calls for. Just remember, our brand is about breaking through the noise that's so often associated with car buying&mdash;all the more reason to be friendly, familiar, and honest.</p>

<h2>How Does That Sound to You?</h2>

<p>A very good rule of thumb is to write like you speak. Imagine you're talking to someone that knows little to nothing about us. Would they understand what you're saying? Would they look at you funny, as if you're trying too hard?</p>

<p>Instead of:</p>

<p><em>"It's the best way to purchase a vehicle."</em></p>

<p>Go with:</p>

<p><em>"It's a great way to buy a car or truck."</em></p>

<p>Note: A truck is not a car. Ask a truck driver, they'll tell you.</p>

<h2>Headlines</h2>

<p>Always title casing. No periods at the end of the headline (unless it's a two-sentence headline).</p>

<p>Example 1: A New Way to Buy a Car</p>

<p>Example 2: A New Way to Buy a Car. A Great Way to Save Money.</p>

<p><a href="http://titlecapitalization.com/">'Titlecapitalization.com'</a> is your co-pilot, the <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em> is your guide&mdash;but only for headlines. For all else, we generally defer to the <em>Associated Press Stylebook</em>.</p>

<p>Headings from h1 to h2 should be capitalized using title case. Headings h3 through h6 should be written out in sentence case.</p>

<h1>We Found Four In-stock Matches for You</h1>

<p>We also use title capitalization in button copy, CTA copy and navigational hyperlinks.</p>

<p>Certain exceptions to this rule do exist.</p>

<p>For example, when listing out the items in a vehicle price breakdown, using title case for all the listed items is acceptable.</p>

<h5><strong>Example:</strong></h5>

<ul>
  <li><strong>MSRP Breakdown</strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Base MSRP: $51,700</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Factory Installed Options: $3,200</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Freight Delivery Charge: $995</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Total MSRP: $55,895</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Title case is all about creating a hierarchy of information.</p>

<p>If you find a use case that doesn't fit these examples, ask yourself if you want any of the information you're writing to be at the top of a hierarchy.</p>

<p>If you <em>do want</em> a sentence or list item to be at the top of a hierarchy, then that sentence or list item should be capitalized using title case.</p>

<h2>Subheadlines</h2>

<p>Regular casing. As with headlines, no periods at the end of the subheadline unless it has two sentences.</p>

<h2>Ampersands</h2>

<p>We can live without ampersands, with three exceptions: ampersands are acceptable in button, navigation or meta data copy for character efficiency.</p>

<h2>Capitalization</h2>

<p>Knowing which words to capitalize and which words not to can be a headache&mdash; especially with so many stakeholders involved. In general, use common sense. However, some specific guidelines: Important words like names, organizations, and events should always be capitalized, and always capitalize the customers that drive our business &ndash; &ldquo;Dealers.&rdquo; This applies to "TrueCar Certified Dealers" and "Dealers" who haven't joined our network. Use lower-casing for "dealerships," unless referring to a "TrueCar Certified Dealership."</p>

<h2>Commas</h2>

<p>We're selective about how we use the Oxford comma. We try to avoid it.</p>

<p>I bake cookies that are gluten-free, soy-free, wheat-free and taste-free.</p>

<p>But, sometimes it's necessary. If you read the sentence out loud and need to pause for a breath, chances are it needs a comma.</p>

<h2>Contractions</h2>

<p>Contractions make us sound friendly and human!</p>

<p>&ldquo;We're&rdquo;</p>

<p>instead of</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Telephone Numbers</h2>

<p>If the number appears in a designed document, use periods between numbers. If it appears as plain text in an email, use hyphens.</p>

<p>Design: 800.200.2000</p>

<p>Email: 800-200-2000</p>

<h2>Time Periods</h2>

<p>Use a number with am or pm&mdash;without a space. Don't use minutes for on-the-hour time.</p>

<p>By 4am, I'm up baking gluten-free rocks for lunch. By 11:30pm, I'm finished cooking them.</p>

<p>Use an en dash between times to indicate time passed.</p>

<p>I binge on CSI: Miami from 11:30pm&ndash;4am.</p>

<h2>Titles</h2>

<p>An employee's title should always be written as name first, title second (spelled out), and if necessary, division or department. The only exception to the &ldquo;spelled out&rdquo; rule is for the CEO, VP, SVP, and EVP title.</p>

<p>There's no need to add TrueCar to anyone's title unless his or her name and title are being used in a non-TrueCar branded environment like a press release or an article in a magazine.</p>

<p>When using titles in a non-TrueCar branded medium:</p>

<h2>Company Names and Products</h2>

<p>Check companies' official websites to find their preferred conventions.</p>

<p>The first mention of a company or product can be with its name. After that, start finding other ways to describe it. For example once you've said TrueCar the first time, start referring to us as &ldquo;we&rdquo; or &ldquo;our.&rdquo;</p></body></html>
