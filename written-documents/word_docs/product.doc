<p>Good product copywriting is concise, clear and mindful of the many different devices that people use to access the Internet.</p>

<p>Good product copywriting also goes out of its way to not irritate a user. Few things will annoy a user <em>more</em> than complicated instructions.</p>

<p>In other words: keep it <strong>simple</strong>, keep it <strong>civil</strong> and keep it <strong>short.</strong></p>

<p>Don't say in 140 characters what you can just as easily say in 50.</p>

<h2>Write in Active Voice</h2>

<p>TrueCar users want reassurance that they are owning the process of using TrueCar. Writing in an active voice empowers the user and adds to TrueCar's authority. Use a steady and consistent tone of voice. Confident but never cocky.</p>

<p><em>You can find your VIN (17 characters) in two places on your vehicle.</em></p>

<p><em>Your VIN (17 characters) can be located in two places on your vehicle.</em></p>

<h2>Omit Adverbs Wherever Possible</h2>

<p>There are times when adverbs are unavoidable. But, more often than not, you can remove them, or a sentence can be re-written to exclude them, without losing the message.</p>

<h5><strong>Exclusion example:</strong></h5>

<p><em>To get your True Cash Offer, find your VIN and click the link below.</em></p>

<p><em>To get your True Cash Offer, simply find your VIN and click the link below.</em></p>

<h5><strong>Rewritten example:</strong></h5>

<p><em>You can redeem your True Cash Offer by dropping your car off at your local dealer.</em></p>

<p><em>You can redeem your True Cash Offer by dropping your car off locally at the dealership.</em></p>

<h2>Avoid Comedy</h2>

<p>A user may return to a screen several times when using TrueCar. What once was clever copy becomes annoying when you read it for the twentieth time.</p>

<h2>Avoid Idioms</h2>

<p>Using idioms (common sayings that aren't meant to be taken literally) in product copy can be disorienting to users. Idioms also have the same disadvantage that comedy has: what is clever the first time you read it becomes tiresome when you read it twenty times.</p>

<h2>Avoid Jargon</h2>

<p>Industry-specific terminology can be intimidating to users who are not familiar with those terms. Whenever possible, try and find common alternatives.</p>

<p><strong>For example:</strong> When describing the price that a user receives from a dealer</p>

<p><em>TrueCar Certified Dealers provide you with real prices on actual cars.</em></p>

<p><em>TrueCar Certified Dealers will provide you with transactable offers on in-stock inventory.</em></p>

<p>If no common alternative exists, be sure to define the term for the user early on.</p>

<p><strong>For example:</strong> When describing what a "VIN" is and why we need it when a user is selling a car through TrueCar.</p>

<p><em>Your Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is a 17-digit number that is unique to your specific car or truck. You'll need to enter this for the dealer to give you an accurate price.</em></p>

<p><em>You must enter your VIN for the dealer to give you an accurate price.</em></p>

<h2>Avoid Puns</h2>

<p>Puns are not universally loved. Avoid introducing puns into the TrueCar product experience.</p>

<h2>Don't Talk Down</h2>

<p>Avoid speaking down to the user or casting actions they've taken in a negative light.</p>

<p><strong>For example:</strong> When a user has entered incorrect information into a form</p>

<p><em>Looks like there's an error in the VIN field. Go back and correct it to continue.</em></p>

<p><em>You've made an error when providing your VIN. Correct it, or you will not be able to continue.</em></p>

<h2>Omit Common Introductory Phrases</h2>

<p>Saying hello is always polite, but once a user is well inside the TrueCar experience, we can cut to the chase.</p>

<p>Here's one example</p>

<p><em>Choose a password to complete your profile.</em></p>

<p><em>The next thing you must do is choose a password to complete your profile.</em></p>

<p>And here is another</p>

<p><em>Enter your VIN to get started</em></p>

<p><em>You must enter your VIN to get started</em></p>

<p>TrueCar users are pretty savvy. Once they get the hang of the TrueCar experience, they won't need the extra prompting that an introductory sentence provides. Save on character count and let them explore.</p>

<h2>Keep it Simple</h2>

<p>Avoid complicated words or phrases. Product copy should attempt to clarify an action, not make it more obscure.</p>

<p><strong>For example:</strong> When explaining to a user why they need to enter their VIN to activate TrueCar Trade:</p>

<p><em>Dealers need your VIN to give you an accurate price for your vehicle.</em></p>

<p><em>Entering your Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) ensures that the dealer will be able to give you accurate pricing information on your vehicle when you reach the dealership.</em></p>

<h2>Points of View</h2>

<h3>Second person point of view</h3>

<p>When addressing a user in a personalized experience, we use the pronouns "your" or "yours." This possessive pronoun usage has a dual purpose: It brings a feeling of personalization into the experience, and it introduces a stronger sense of ownership.</p>

<p><em>Here is the Price Report for your 2017 Nissan Altima</em></p>

<p><em>Here is the Price Report for a 2017 Nissan Altima</em></p>

<p>The exception to this rule: You may use the first person possessive pronoun "My" as a navigation element when you are trying to describe an element i.e. "My Account."</p>

<p>However, when you are writing descriptive copy to describe this element, never mix "my / mine" with "you / your" as it can cause confusion.</p>

<h3>First person point of view</h3>

<p>TrueCar user experience copy should focus on the benefit to the user. Using first person pronouns "I" or "We" diminishes this emphasis. TrueCar is seldom "doing" something for the user. The user is discovering things for themselves.</p>

<p><em>There are three dealers with eight offers ready for your review.</em></p>

<p><em>We have found three dealers with eight offers ready for your review.</em></p>
