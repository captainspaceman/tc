<h2>Grammar Rules (except when it doesn't)</h2>

<p>It's okay to occasionally break with the rules of grammar&mdash;after all, we're supposed to write as if we're speaking, and conversational English is not always grammatically correct. But if you do break the rules, make sure it makes sense.</p>

<h2>The Rule on Periods, Period.</h2>

<p>Only one space after a period before starting the next sentence.</p>

<h2>Abbreviations and Acronyms</h2>

<p>If it's possible a reader won't understand or recognize an abbreviation or acronym, then spell it out, at least the first time it's used, then add the acronym with parentheses. If it's a widely known abbreviation&mdash;say, DVD or FYI&mdash;then the short form is fine.</p>

<h2>Asterisks</h2>

<p>As a rule, asterisks tend to denote dishonesty&mdash;as in the first thing your brain says when it sees one is, &ldquo;I knew there was a catch.&rdquo; However, if you must use them (as is often the case when dealing with, say, &ldquo;save up to&rdquo; offers), just remember there's nothing to hide. Translation, don't follow up your asterisk with &ldquo;small print.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Bullets</h2>

<p>When using bullets, make sure they answer the lead-in copy and that there are no periods at the end (unless it's comprised of two or more sentences). The opening of each bullet should ideally be a verb.</p>

<p>TrueCar allows you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Buy with confidence</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Get a great deal on a car. You'll even get locked-in savings.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>See what others paid for the car you want</li>
</ul>

<h2>Citations and Stats</h2>

<p>If you quote a source or throw down a stat, you'll often need to site your source. When you do, here's how you'll need to format it (based on the <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em>). Use this for slide presentations, print ads, and collateral. <em>Author First Name Last Name, Publication or Organization, &ldquo;Title,&rdquo; Month Year</em></p>

<p>Derrick Feldmann, Achieve, &ldquo;Inspiring the Next Generation Workforce: The 2014 Millennial Impact Report,&rdquo; June 2014</p>

<p>If no author is listed, start with the organization</p>

<p>comScore, &ldquo;The U.S. Mobile App Report,&rdquo; August 2014</p>

<p>If there are multiple authors, list the first and add &ldquo;et al.&rdquo;:</p>

<p>Julie Bezerra, et al., Boston Consulting Group, &ldquo;The Mobile Revolution: How Mobile Technologies Drive a Trillion-Dollar Impact,&rdquo; January 2015</p>

<p>If space is limited, use one of the formats below:</p>

<p>Boston Consulting Group, &ldquo;The Mobile Revolution: How Mobile Technologies Drive a Trillion-Dollar Impact,&rdquo; January 2015</p>

<p>Boston Consulting Group, &ldquo;The Mobile Revolution: How Mobile Technologies Drive a Trillion-Dollar Impact,&rdquo; Jan. 2015</p>

<p>Boston Consulting Group, Jan. 2015</p>

<p>Boston Consulting Group</p>

<h2>Data</h2>

<p>Treat &ldquo;data&rdquo; as singular.</p>

<p>The data shows that...</p>

<h2>Dates</h2>

<p>Spell out the day and the month.</p>

<p>My training as a rodeo cowboy began on Sunday, January 24.</p>

<h2>Ellipses</h2>

<p>In general, we don't use them. But if you must here's the example:</p>

<p>It's a right of passage when you get your driver's license &mldr; you gain independence &mldr; freedom.</p>

<p>We use three dots and space once before they begin and once after they end.</p>

<h2>Em Dashes</h2>

<p>Use an em dash (&mdash;) without spaces to set off a parenthetical statement (yes, we had to look it up the first time, too). Don't use two hyphens in place of an em dash.</p>

<p>Writing straightforward, clear copy isn't as easy as you'd imagine&mdash;especially if you're used to writing for companies that don't place as high an emphasis on transparency.</p>

<h2>En Dashes</h2>

<p>Wider than a hyphen but shorter than an Em Dash. It's used between ranges of numbers or dates: 2005&ndash;2015, pages 25&ndash;64, and between two-word adjectives: &ldquo;I'm taking the LAX&ndash;NYC flight.&rdquo; There are no spaces before or after the en dash.</p>

<h2>Exclamation Points</h2>

<p>Use judiciously. Should indicate that something is exceptional or rare.</p>

<h2>Flagrant Formatting</h2>

<p>The meaning of your words should come through without the use of italics, bold, caps, and underline. If you absolutely feel that you <em>MUST</em> flagrantly format, work it out with the designer or creative director.</p>

<h2>Media</h2>

<p>Movies, documentaries, books, magazines, and TV shows should always be italicized. However, characters from within those properties should not.</p>

<h2>Numbers</h2>

<p>Spell out one through nine and first through ninth, and spell out a number if it's the first word of a sentence. Anything else can be presented as numerals.</p>

<p>When describing a large number (over 100) use the figure/numeral rule:</p>

<p>2 million</p>

<p>It takes 120&ndash;150 days to bake the perfect gluten-free, soy-free, wheat-free cake.</p>

<p>Don't say &ldquo;1/2.&rdquo; Instead spell out &ldquo;half.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Spell out percent.</p>

<p>Use &ldquo;times&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;X&rdquo; (Unless it's in a headline. Then all rules are off).</p>

<p>Four times as many sales.</p>

<p>Another pitfall to avoid is a &ldquo;+&rdquo; or &ldquo;&ndash;&rdquo; in body copy. Don't say &ldquo;400+ Dealers,&rdquo; instead say, &ldquo;Over 400 Dealers.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Quotes</h2>

<p>Periods always go <em>inside</em> of quotes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's not just about getting the best possible price,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It's about knowing you didn't get screwed.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Telephone Numbers</h2>

<p>If the number appears in a designed document, use periods between numbers. If it appears as plain text in an email, use hyphens.</p>

<p>Design: 800.200.2000</p>

<p>Email: 800-200-2000</p>

<h2>Time Periods</h2>

<p>Use a number with am or pm&mdash;without a space. Don't use minutes for on-the-hour time.</p>

<p>By 4am, I'm up baking gluten-free rocks for lunch. By 11:30pm, I'm finished cooking them.</p>

<p>Use an en dash between times to indicate time passed.</p>

<p>I binge on CSI: Miami from 11:30pm&ndash;4am.</p>

<h2>Titles</h2>

<p>An employee's title should always be written as name first, title second (spelled out), and if necessary, division or department. The only exception to the &ldquo;spelled out&rdquo; rule is for the CEO, VP, SVP, and EVP title.</p>

<p>There's no need to add TrueCar to anyone's title unless his or her name and title are being used in a non-TrueCar branded environment like a press release or an article in a magazine.</p>

<p>Brian Skutta, EVP, Dealer Sales and Service</p>

<p>When using titles in a non-TrueCar branded medium:</p>

<p>Landon Manjikian, Marketing Manager, TrueCar</p>

<h2>Hyphens</h2>

<p>When you take two different words and combine them to make an adjective (i.e. values-based, purpose-driven, hyper-connected, gluten-free) you should use a hyphen.</p></body></html>
