      <h1>How to Write for Brand</h1>
    </div>

          <p>"We exist to be <mark>the most transparent brand in automotive</mark>, to serve as a catalyst that dramatically improves the way people discover, buy and sell cars."</p>

          <p><strong>Transparency:</strong> to all of us here, it's more than just a word&mdash;it's our north star. Which is why everything we communicate should always tether back to this core value. Copy that's too clever or &ldquo;addy&rdquo; isn't really us. That doesn't mean it can't be loose or fun. On the contrary, it can be whatever the job calls for. Just remember, our brand is about breaking through the noise that's so often associated with car buying&mdash;all the more reason to be friendly, familiar, and honest.</p>

    <span id="voice-and-tone"><a name="voice-and-tone"></a></span>

        <h2>How Does That Sound to You?</h2>

          <p>A very good rule of thumb is to write like you speak. Imagine you're talking to someone that knows little to nothing about us. Would they understand what you're saying? Would they look at you funny, as if you're trying too hard?</p>
    
              <aside class="example">

                <p>Instead of:</p>

                <p class="bad"><em>"It's the best way to purchase a vehicle."</em></p>

                <p>Go with:</p>

                <p class="good"><em>"It's a great way to buy a car or truck."</em></p>

              </aside>

          <p>Note: A truck is not a car. Ask a truck driver, they'll tell you.</p>

    <span id="headlines"><a name="headlines"></a></span>
        <h2>Headlines</h2>
            <p>Always title casing. No periods at the end of the headline (unless it's a two-sentence headline).</p>

                        <aside class="example">
                          <p>Example 1: A New Way to Buy a Car</p>
                          <p>Example 2: A New Way to Buy a Car. A Great Way to Save Money.</p>
                        </aside>

                    <p><a href="http://titlecapitalization.com">'Titlecapitalization.com'</a> is your co-pilot, the <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em> is your guide&mdash;but only for headlines. For all else, we generally defer to the <em>Associated Press Stylebook</em>.</p>

    <span id="subheadlines"><a name="subheadlines"></a></span>
            <h2>Subheadlines</h2>
                <p>Regular casing. As with headlines, no periods at the end of the subheadline unless it has two sentences.</p>

     <span id="ampersands"><a name="ampersands"></a></span>
            <h2>Ampersands</h2>
                <p>We can live without ampersands, with three exceptions: ampersands are acceptable in button, navigation or meta data copy for character efficiency.</p>

    <span id="capitalization"><a name="capitalization"></a></span>

            <h2>Capitalization</h2>

                <p>Knowing which words to capitalize and which words not to can be a headache&mdash; especially with so many stakeholders involved. In general, use common sense. However, some specific guidelines: Important words like names, organizations, and events should always be capitalized, and always capitalize the customers that drive our business – &ldquo;Dealers.&rdquo; This applies to "TrueCar Certified Dealers" and "Dealers" who haven&#39;t joined our network. Use lower-casing for "dealerships," unless referring to a "TrueCar Certified Dealership."</p>

     <span id="commas"><a name="commas"></a></span>
            <h2>Commas</h2>
                <p>We're selective about how we use the Oxford comma. We try to avoid it.</p>
                     
                        <aside class="example">
                          <p>I bake cookies that are gluten-free, soy-free, wheat-free and taste-free.</p>
                        </aside>
                            <p>But, sometimes it's necessary. If you read the sentence out loud and need to pause for a breath, chances are it needs a comma.</p>

    <span id="contractions"><a name="contractions"></a></span>

            <h2>Contractions</h2>
                <p>Contractions make us sound friendly and human!</p>
                    
                        <aside class="example">
                          <p class="good">&ldquo;We're&rdquo;</p>
                          <p>instead of
                            <p>
                              <p class="bad">&ldquo;We are.&rdquo;</p>
                        </aside>

   
   <span id="telephone-numbers"><a name="telephone-numbers"></a></span>
            <h2>Telephone Numbers</h2>
                <p>If the number appears in a designed document, use periods between numbers. If it appears as plain text in an email, use hyphens.</p>

                          <aside class="example">
                            <p>Design: 800.200.2000 </p>

                            <p>Email: 800-200-2000</p>
                          </aside>

        <span id="time-periods"><a name="time-periods"></a></span>
            <h2>Time Periods</h2>
                <p>Use a number with am or pm&mdash;without a space. Don't use minutes for on-the-hour time.</p>

                          <aside class="example">
                            <p>By 4am, I'm up baking gluten-free rocks for lunch. By 11:30pm, I'm finished cooking them.</p>
                          </aside>

                <p>Use an en dash between times to indicate time passed.

                            <aside class="example">
                              <p>I binge on CSI: Miami from 11:30pm–4am.</p>
                            </aside>

        <span id="titles"><a name="titles"></a></span>
            <h2>Titles</h2>
                <p>An employee's title should always be written as name first, title second (spelled out), and if necessary, division or department. The only exception to the &ldquo;spelled out&rdquo; rule is for the CEO, VP, SVP, and EVP title. </p>

                <p>There's no need to add TrueCar to anyone's title unless his or her name and title are being used in a non-TrueCar branded environment like a press release or an article in a magazine.</p>

                            <aside class="example">
                              <p>Brian Skutta, EVP, Dealer Sales and Service</p>
                            </aside>

                <p>When using titles in a non-TrueCar branded medium:</p>

                            <aside class="example">
                              <p>Landon Manjikian, Marketing Manager, TrueCar</p>
                            </aside>

        <span id="company-labels"><a name="company-labels"></a></span>

            <h2>Company Names and Products</h2>
                <p>Check companies' official websites to find their preferred conventions.</p>

                <p>The first mention of a company or product can be with its name. After that, start finding other ways to describe it. For example once you've said TrueCar the first time, start referring to us as &ldquo;we&rdquo; or &ldquo;our.&rdquo;</p>

<!--         <span id="certified-dealers"><a name="certified-dealers"></a></span>      
        <h2>TrueCar Certified Dealers</h2>
           <p>Simply put, they're our customers and thus what drives our business. We respect their voice and embrace it. So much so that they're often a key source of insight behind what we do. And remember, TrueCar Dealers aren't the only ones who see our work. Other Dealers do too; and ultimately, it's our goal to have them join us.</p> -->
