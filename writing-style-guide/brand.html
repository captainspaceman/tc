      <h1>How to Write for Brand</h1>
    </div>

    <span id="our-mission"><a name="our-mission"></a></span>
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>We exist to be the most transparent brand in automotive, to serve as a catalyst that dramatically improves the way people discover, buy and sell cars.</p>

          <p><strong>Transparency.</strong> To all of us here, it's more than just a word&mdash;it's our north star. Which is why everything we communicate should always tether back to this core value. Copy that's too clever or &ldquo;addy&rdquo; isn't really us. That doesn't mean it can't be loose or fun. On the contrary, it can be whatever the job calls for. Just remember, our brand is about breaking through the noise that's so often associated with car buying&mdash;all the more reason to be friendly, familiar, and honest.</p>

    <span id="voice-and-tone"><a name="voice-and-tone"></a></span>

        <h2>How Does That Sound to You?</h2>

          <p>A very good rule of thumb is to write like you speak. Imagine you're talking to someone that knows little to nothing about us. Would they understand what you're saying? Would they look at you funny, as if you're trying too hard?</p>
    
              <aside class="example">

                <p>Instead of:</p>

                <p class="bad"><em>"It's the best way to purchase a vehicle."</em></p>

                <p>Go with:</p>

                <p class="good"><em>"It's a great way to buy a car or truck."</em></p>

              </aside>

          <p>Note: A truck is not a car. Ask a truck driver, they'll tell you.</p>

    <span id="certified-dealers"><a name="certified-dealers"></a></span>      
        <h2>TrueCar Certified Dealers</h2>
           <p>Simply put, they're our customers and thus what drives our business. We respect their voice and embrace it. So much so that they're often a key source of insight behind what we do. And remember, TrueCar Dealers aren't the only ones who see our work. Other Dealers do too; and ultimately, it's our goal to have them join us.</p>

    <span id="grammar-rules"><a name="grammar-rules"></a></span>
        <h2>Grammar Rules (except when it doesn't)</h2>
            <p>It's okay to occasionally break with the rules of grammar&mdash;after all, we're supposed to write as if we're speaking, and conversational English is not always grammatically correct. But if you do break the rules, make sure it makes sense.</p>
            <p>For more specific rules on grammar and punctuation, visit <a href="various.html">this page.</a>


   
   <span id="telephone-numbers"><a name="telephone-numbers"></a></span>
            <h2>Telephone Numbers</h2>
                <p>If the number appears in a designed document, use periods between numbers. If it appears as plain text in an email, use hyphens.</p>

                          <aside class="example">
                            <p>Design: 800.200.2000 </p>

                            <p>Email: 800-200-2000</p>
                          </aside>

        <span id="time-periods"><a name="time-periods"></a></span>
            <h2>Time Periods</h2>
                <p>Use a number with am or pm&mdash;without a space. Don't use minutes for on-the-hour time.</p>

                          <aside class="example">
                            <p>By 4am, I'm up baking gluten-free rocks for lunch. By 11:30pm, I'm finished cooking them.</p>
                          </aside>

                <p>Use an en dash between times to indicate time passed.

                            <aside class="example">
                              <p>I binge on CSI: Miami from 11:30pmâ€“4am.</p>
                            </aside>

        <span id="titles"><a name="titles"></a></span>
            <h2>Titles</h2>
                <p>An employee's title should always be written as name first, title second (spelled out), and if necessary, division or department. The only exception to the &ldquo;spelled out&rdquo; rule is for the CEO, VP, SVP, and EVP title. </p>

                <p>There's no need to add TrueCar to anyone's title unless his or her name and title are being used in a non-TrueCar branded environment like a press release or an article in a magazine.</p>

                            <aside class="example">
                              <p>Brian Skutta, EVP, Dealer Sales and Service</p>
                            </aside>

                <p>When using titles in a non-TrueCar branded medium:</p>

                            <aside class="example">
                              <p>Landon Manjikian, Marketing Manager, TrueCar</p>
                            </aside>

        <span id="company-labels"><a name="company-labels"></a></span>

            <h2>Company Names and Products</h2>
                <p>Check companies' official websites to find their preferred conventions.</p>

                <p>The first mention of a company or product can be with its name. After that, start finding other ways to describe it. For example once you've said TrueCar the first time, start referring to us as &ldquo;we&rdquo; or &ldquo;our.&rdquo;</p>
