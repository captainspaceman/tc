      <h1>Welcome to TrueCar</h1>
    </div>

    <h2>Transparency</h2>
    <p>To all of us here, it's more than just a word&mdash;it's our north star. Which is why everything we communicate should always tether back to this core value. Copy that's too clever or &ldquo;addy&rdquo; isn't really us. That doesn't mean it can't
      be loose or fun. On the contrary, it can be whatever the job calls for. Just remember, our brand is about breaking through the noise that's so often associated with car buying&mdash;all the more reason to be friendly, familiar, and honest.</p>

    <h2>How Does That Sound to You?</h2>
    <p>
      A very good rule of thumb is to write like you speak. Imagine you're talking to someone that knows little to nothing about us. Would they understand what you're saying? Would they look at you funny, as if you're trying too hard?</p>
    <h5>Example:</h5>

        <aside class="example">

          <p>Instead of:</p>

          <p class="bad"><em>"It's the best way to purchase a vehicle."</em></p>

          <p>Go with:</p>

          <p class="good"><em>"It's a great way to buy a car or truck."</em></p>


        </aside>

    <p>Note: A truck is not a car. Ask a truck driver, they'll tell you.</p>

    <h2>TrueCar Certified Dealers</h2>
    <p>
      Simply put, they're our customers and thus what drives our business. We respect their voice and embrace it. So much so that they're often a key source of insight behind what we do. And remember, TrueCar Dealers aren't the only ones who see our work. Other
      Dealers do too; and ultimately, it's our goal to have them join us.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Rules (except when it doesn't)</h2>
    <p>
      It's okay to occasionally break with the rules of grammar&mdash;after all, we're supposed to write as if we're speaking, and conversational English is not always grammatically correct. But if you do break the rules, make sure it makes sense.</p>

    <h2>The Rule on Periods, Period.</h2>
    <p>
      Only one space after a period before starting the next sentence.</p>

    <h2>Headlines</h2>
    <p>
      Always title casing. No periods at the end of the headline (unless it's a two-sentence headline).</p>

    <aside class="example">
      <p>Example 1: A New Way to Buy a Car</p>
      <p>Example 2: A New Way to Buy a Car. A Great Way to Save Money.</p>
    </aside>

    <p>Titlecapitalization.com is your co-pilot, the <em>Chicago Manual of Sty</em>le is your guide&mdash;but only for headlines. For all else, we generally defer to the <em>Associated Press Stylebook</em>.</p>

    <h2>Subheadlines</h2>
    <p>
      Regular casing. As with headlines, no periods at the end of the subheadline unless it has two sentences.
    </p>
    <h2>Abbreviations and Acronyms</h2>
    <p>
      If it's possible a reader won't understand or recognize an abbreviation or acronym, then spell it out, at least the first time it's used, then add the acronym with parentheses. If it's a widely known abbreviation&mdash;say, DVD or FYI&mdash;then the short
      form is fine.</p>

    <h2>Ampersands</h2>
    <p>
      We can live without ampersands. One exception, ampersands are acceptable in &lsquo;Button' copy for character efficiency.</p>

    <h2>Asterisks</h2>
    <p>
      As a rule, asterisks tend to denote dishonesty&mdash;as in the first thing your brain says when it sees one is, &ldquo;I knew there was a catch.&rdquo; However, if you must use them (as is often the case when dealing with, say, &ldquo;save up to&rdquo;
      offers), just remember there's nothing to hide. Translation, don't follow up your asterisk with &ldquo;small print.&rdquo;</p>

    <h2>Bullets</h2>
    <p>
      When using bullets, make sure they answer the lead-in copy and that there are no periods at the end (unless it's comprised of two or more sentences). The opening of each bullet should ideally be a verb.</p>

    <h5>Example:</h5>
    <aside class="example">
      <p>TrueCar allows you to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Buy with confidence</li>
        <li>Get a great deal on a car. You'll even get locked-in savings.</li>
        <li>See what others paid for the car you want</li>
      </ul>
    </aside>
    <h2>Capitalization</h2>
    <p>
      Knowing which words to capitalize and which words not to can be a headache&mdash; especially with so many stakeholders involved. In general, use common sense. However, some specific guidelines: Important words like names, organizations, and events should
      always be capitalized, and always capitalize the customers that drive our business – &ldquo;Dealers.&rdquo; This applies to "TrueCar Certified Dealers" and "Dealers" who haven&#39;t joined our network. Use lower-casing for "dealerships," unless
      referring to a "TrueCar Certified Dealership."</p>

    <h2>Citations and Stats </h2>

    <p>If you quote a source or throw down a stat, you'll often need to site your source. When you do, here's how you'll need to format it (based on the <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em>). Use this for slide presentations, print ads, and collateral. <em>Author First Name Last Name, Publication or Organization, &ldquo;Title,&rdquo; Month Year</em></p>

    <h5>Example:</h5>

    <aside class="example">

      <p>Derrick Feldmann, Achieve, &ldquo;Inspiring the Next Generation Workforce: The 2014 Millennial Impact Report,&rdquo; June 2014</p>

    </aside>

    <p>If no author is listed, start with the organization</p>

    <aside class="example">

      <p>comScore, &ldquo;The U.S. Mobile App Report,&rdquo; August 2014</p>

    </aside>

    <p>If there are multiple authors, list the first and add &ldquo;et al.&rdquo;:</p>

    <aside class="example">

      <p class="good ">Julie Bezerra, et al., Boston Consulting Group, &ldquo;The Mobile Revolution: How Mobile Technologies Drive a Trillion-Dollar Impact,&rdquo; January 2015</p>

    </aside>

    <p>If space is limited, use one of the formats below:</p>

    <aside class="example">

      <p>Boston Consulting Group, &ldquo;The Mobile Revolution: How Mobile Technologies Drive a Trillion-Dollar Impact,&rdquo; January 2015</p>

      <p>Boston Consulting Group, &ldquo;The Mobile Revolution: How Mobile Technologies Drive a Trillion-Dollar Impact,&rdquo; Jan. 2015</p>

      <p>Boston Consulting Group, Jan. 2015</p>

      <p>Boston Consulting Group</p>

    </aside>

    <h2>Commas</h2>

    <p>We're selective about how we use the Oxford comma. We try to avoid it.</p>

    <h5>Example: </h5>

    <aside class="example">

      <p>I bake cookies that are gluten-free, soy-free, wheat-free and taste-free.</p>

    </aside>

    <p>But, sometimes it's necessary. If you read the sentence out loud and need to pause for a breath, chances are it needs a comma.</p>

    <h2>Company Names and Products</h2>
    <p>
      Check companies' official websites to find their preferred conventions.</p>

    <p>The first mention of a company or product can be with its name. After that, start finding other ways to describe it. For example once you've said TrueCar the first time, start referring to us as &ldquo;we&rdquo; or &ldquo;our.&rdquo;</p>

    <h2>Contractions</h2>
    <p>
      Contractions make us sound friendly and human!</p>

    <h5>Example:</h5>
    <aside class="example">
      <p>&ldquo;We're&rdquo;</p>
      <p>instead of
        <p>
          <p>&ldquo;We are.&rdquo;</p>
    </aside>
    <h2>Data</h2>
    <p>
      Treat &ldquo;data&rdquo; as singular.</p>

    <h5>Example: </h5>
    <p>The data shows that...</p>

    <h2>Dates</h2>
    <p>
      Spell out the day and the month.</p>

    <h5>Example</h5>

    <aside class="example">
      <p>My training as a rodeo cowboy began on Sunday, January 24.</p>
    </aside>

    <h2>Ellipses</h2>
    <p>
      In general, we don't use them. But if you must here's the example:</p>

    <p>It's a right of passage when you get your driver's license … you gain independence … freedom.</p>

    <p>We use three dots and space once before they begin and once after they end.</p>

    <h2>Em Dashes</h2>
    <p>
      Use an em dash (&mdash;) without spaces to set off a parenthetical statement (yes, we had to look it up the first time, too). Don't use two hyphens in place of an em dash.</p>

    <h5>Example</h5>
    <aside class="example">
      <p>Writing straightforward, clear copy isn't as easy as you'd imagine&mdash;especially if you're used to writing for companies that don't place as high an emphasis on transparency.</p>
    </aside>

    <h2>En Dashes</h2>
    <p>
      Wider than a hyphen but shorter than an Em Dash. It's used between ranges of numbers or dates: 2005–2015, pages 25–64, and between two-word adjectives: &ldquo;I'm taking the LAX–NYC flight.&rdquo; There are no spaces before or after the en dash.</p>

    <h2>Exclamation Points</h2>

    <p>Use judiciously. Should indicate that something is exceptional or rare.</p>

    <h2>Flagrant Formatting</h2>
    <p>
      The meaning of your words should come through without the use of italics, bold, caps, and underline. If you absolutely feel that you <em>MUST </em>flagrantly format, work it out with the designer or creative director.</p>

    <h2>Hyphens</h2>
    <p>
      When you take two different words and combine them to make an adjective (i.e. values-based, purpose-driven, hyper-connected, gluten-free) you should use a hyphen.</p>

    <h2>Media</h2>
    <p>
      Movies, documentaries, books, magazines, and TV shows should always be italicized. However, characters from within those properties should not.</p>

    <h2>Numbers</h2>
    <p>
      Spell out one through nine and first through ninth, and spell out a number if it's the first word of a sentence. Anything else can be presented as numerals.</p>



    <p>When describing a large number (over 100) use the figure/numeral rule:</p>

    <aside class="example">
      <p>2 million</p>
      <p> It takes 120–150 days to bake the perfect gluten-free, soy-free, wheat-free cake.</p>

    </aside>

    <p>Don't say &ldquo;1/2.&rdquo; Instead spell out &ldquo;half.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Spell out percent.</p>


    <p>Use &ldquo;times&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;X&rdquo; (Unless it's in a headline. Then all rules are off).

      <h5>Example:</h5>

      <aside class="example">

        <p>Four times as ma3ny sales.</p>

      </aside>

      <p>Another pitfall to avoid is a &ldquo;+&rdquo; or &ldquo;–&rdquo; in body copy. Don't say &ldquo;400+ Dealers,&rdquo; instead say, &ldquo;Over 400 Dealers.&rdquo;</p>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      <p>
        Periods always go <em>inside </em>of quotes.</p>

      <h5>Example:</h5>

      <aside class="example">
        <p>&ldquo;It's not just about getting the best possible price,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It's about knowing you didn't get screwed.&rdquo;</p>
      </aside>
      <h2></h2>
      <h2>Telephone Numbers</h2>
      <p>
        If the number appears in a designed document, use periods between numbers. If it appears as plain text in an email, use hyphens.</p>

      <h5>Examples</h5>

      <aside class="example">
        <p>Design: 800.200.2000 </p>

        <p>Email: 800-200-2000</p>

      </aside>

      <h2>Time Periods</h2>
      <p>Use a number with am or pm&mdash;without a space. Don't use minutes for on-the-hour time.</p>


      <h5>Example:</h5>

      <aside class="example">

        <p>By 4am, I'm up baking gluten-free rocks for lunch. By 11:30pm, I'm finished cooking them.</p>

      </aside>

      <p>Use an en dash between times to indicate time passed.

        <h5>Example:</h5>
        <aside class="example">
          <p>I binge on CSI: Miami from 11:30pm–4am.</p>
        </aside>

        <h2>Titles</h2>
        <p>An employee's title should always be written as name first, title second (spelled out), and if necessary, division or department. The only exception to the &ldquo;spelled out&rdquo; rule is for the CEO, VP, SVP, and EVP title. </p>
        <p>There's no need to add TrueCar to anyone's title unless his or her name and title are being used in a non-TrueCar branded environment like a press release or an article in a magazine.</p>

        <h5>Example:</h5>

        <aside class="example">

          <p>Brian Skutta, EVP, Dealer Sales and Service</p>

        </aside>

        <h5>Example (non-TrueCar branded medium):</h5>

        <aside class="example">
          <p>Landon Manjikian, Marketing Manager, TrueCar</p>
        </aside>
