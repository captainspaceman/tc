      <h1>How to Write for Brand</h1>
    </div>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>

    <p>We exist to be the most transparent brand in automotive, to serve as a catalyst that dramatically improves the way people discover, buy and sell cars.</p>

  
    <p><strong>Transparency.</strong> To all of us here, it's more than just a word&mdash;it's our north star. Which is why everything we communicate should always tether back to this core value. Copy that's too clever or &ldquo;addy&rdquo; isn't really us. That doesn't mean it can't be loose or fun. On the contrary, it can be whatever the job calls for. Just remember, our brand is about breaking through the noise that's so often associated with car buying&mdash;all the more reason to be friendly, familiar, and honest.</p>

    <h2>How Does That Sound to You?</h2>
    <p>
      A very good rule of thumb is to write like you speak. Imagine you're talking to someone that knows little to nothing about us. Would they understand what you're saying? Would they look at you funny, as if you're trying too hard?</p>
    <h5>Example:</h5>

        <aside class="example">

          <p>Instead of:</p>

          <p class="bad"><em>"It's the best way to purchase a vehicle."</em></p>

          <p>Go with:</p>

          <p class="good"><em>"It's a great way to buy a car or truck."</em></p>


        </aside>

    <p>Note: A truck is not a car. Ask a truck driver, they'll tell you.</p>

    <h2>TrueCar Certified Dealers</h2>
    <p>
      Simply put, they're our customers and thus what drives our business. We respect their voice and embrace it. So much so that they're often a key source of insight behind what we do. And remember, TrueCar Dealers aren't the only ones who see our work. Other
      Dealers do too; and ultimately, it's our goal to have them join us.</p>

    <h2>Grammar Rules (except when it doesn't)</h2>
    <p>
      It's okay to occasionally break with the rules of grammar&mdash;after all, we're supposed to write as if we're speaking, and conversational English is not always grammatically correct. But if you do break the rules, make sure it makes sense.</p>


    <h2>Media</h2>
    <p>
      Movies, documentaries, books, magazines, and TV shows should always be italicized. However, characters from within those properties should not.</p>

    <h2>Numbers</h2>
    <p>Spell out one through nine and first through ninth, and spell out a number if it's the first word of a sentence. Anything else can be presented as numerals.</p>



          <p>When describing a large number (over 100) use the figure/numeral rule:</p>

              <aside class="example">
                <p>2 million</p>
                <p> It takes 120–150 days to bake the perfect gluten-free, soy-free, wheat-free cake.</p>

              </aside>

                <p>Don't say &ldquo;1/2.&rdquo; Instead spell out &ldquo;half.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Spell out percent.</p>


                <p>Use &ldquo;times&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;X&rdquo; (Unless it's in a headline. Then all rules are off).

      <h5>Example:</h5>

      <aside class="example">

        <p>Four times as many sales.</p>

      </aside>

      <p>Another pitfall to avoid is a &ldquo;+&rdquo; or &ldquo;–&rdquo; in body copy. Don't say &ldquo;400+ Dealers,&rdquo; instead say, &ldquo;Over 400 Dealers.&rdquo;</p>

      <h2>Quotes</h2>
      <p>
        Periods always go <em>inside </em>of quotes.</p>

      <h5>Example:</h5>

      <aside class="example">
        <p>&ldquo;It's not just about getting the best possible price,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It's about knowing you didn't get screwed.&rdquo;</p>
      </aside>
      <h2></h2>
      <h2>Telephone Numbers</h2>
      <p>
        If the number appears in a designed document, use periods between numbers. If it appears as plain text in an email, use hyphens.</p>

      <h5>Examples</h5>

      <aside class="example">
        <p>Design: 800.200.2000 </p>

        <p>Email: 800-200-2000</p>

      </aside>

      <h2>Time Periods</h2>
      <p>Use a number with am or pm&mdash;without a space. Don't use minutes for on-the-hour time.</p>


      <h5>Example:</h5>

      <aside class="example">

        <p>By 4am, I'm up baking gluten-free rocks for lunch. By 11:30pm, I'm finished cooking them.</p>

      </aside>

      <p>Use an en dash between times to indicate time passed.

        <h5>Example:</h5>
        <aside class="example">
          <p>I binge on CSI: Miami from 11:30pm–4am.</p>
        </aside>

        <h2>Titles</h2>
        <p>An employee's title should always be written as name first, title second (spelled out), and if necessary, division or department. The only exception to the &ldquo;spelled out&rdquo; rule is for the CEO, VP, SVP, and EVP title. </p>
        <p>There's no need to add TrueCar to anyone's title unless his or her name and title are being used in a non-TrueCar branded environment like a press release or an article in a magazine.</p>

        <h5>Example:</h5>

        <aside class="example">

          <p>Brian Skutta, EVP, Dealer Sales and Service</p>

        </aside>

        <h5>Example (non-TrueCar branded medium):</h5>

        <aside class="example">
          <p>Landon Manjikian, Marketing Manager, TrueCar</p>
        </aside>
