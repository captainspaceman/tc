            <h1>How to Write for Product</h1>

        </div>


            <p>When writing for product, you have to think about device size, user behavior and marketing concerns, all while writing plain old fashioned "good advice" that will makes it easier for a user to get where they're going.</p>

            <p>Follow this rule: the shorter, the better. </p>
            <p>Don't say in 140 characters what you can say in 50. What reads well on a screen that is 1440 pixels wide might be microscopic on a device that is 320 pixels wide. </p>

            <p>Everything else is just good writing. Reference the <a href="brand.html">TrueCar brand page</a> for more on this.</p>

<span id="dont-talk-down"><a name="dont-talk-down"></a></span>
    <h2>Don't Talk Down</h2>

<p>Avoid speaking down to the user or casting actions they've taken in a negative light.</p>

<h5>Example:</h5>
        <p> When a user has entered incorrect information into a form</p>

        <aside class="example">

                <p class="good"><em> Looks like there's an error in the VIN field. Go back and correct it to continue.</em></p>

                <p class="bad"><em> You've made an error when providing your VIN. Correct it, or you will not be able to continue.</em></p>
        </aside>
<span id="avoid-jargon"><a name="avoid-jargon"></a></span>
        <h2>Avoid Jargon</h2>

<p>Industry-specific terminology can be intimidating to users who are not familiar with those terms. Whenever possible, try and find common alternatives.</p>

<h5>Example:</h5>
        <p>When describing the price that a user receives from a dealer</p>
        <aside class="example">
            <p class="good"><em> TrueCar Certified Dealers provide you with real prices on actual cars.</em></p>

            <p class="bad"><em> TrueCar Certified Dealers will provide you with transactable offers on in-stock inventory.</em></p>
        </aside>
<p>If no common alternative exists, be sure to define the term for the user early on.</p>

<h5>Example:</h5>
        <p>When describing the need for a VIN when a user is selling a car through TrueCar.</p>


        <aside class="example">
            <p class="good"><em> Your Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is a 17-digit number that is unique to your specific car or truck. You'll need to enter this for the dealer to give you an accurate price.</em></p>

            <p class="bad"><em> You must enter your VIN for the dealer to give you an accurate price.</em></p>
        </aside>
        <span id="keep-it-simple"><a name="keep-it-simple"></a></span>
            <h2>Keep it Simple</h2>

<p>Avoid complicated words or phrases. Product copy should attempt to clarify an action, not make it more obscure.</p>

<h5>Example:</h5>
    <p>When explaining to a user why they need to enter their VIN to activate TrueCar Trade:</p>

        <aside class="example">

            <p class="good"><em>Dealers need your VIN to give you an accurate price for your vehicle.</em></p>

            <p class="bad"> <em>Entering your Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) ensures that the dealer will be able to give you accurate pricing information on your vehicle when you reach the dealership.</em></p>

        </aside>
   <span id="avoid-comedy"><a name="avoid-comedy"></a></span>
        <h2>Avoid Comedy</h2>


<p>A user may return to a screen several times when using TrueCar. What once was clever copy becomes annoying when you read it for the twentieth time.</p>

   <span id="avoid-idioms"><a name="avoid-idioms"></a></span>
            <h2>Avoid Idioms</h2>

<p>Using idioms (common sayings that aren't meant to be taken literally) in product copy can be disorienting to users. Idioms also have the same disadvantage that comedy has: what is clever the first time you read it becomes tiresome when you read it twenty times.</p>

<span id="avoid-puns"><a name="avoid-puns"></a></span>
        <h2>Avoid Puns</h2>

            <p>Puns are not universally loved. Avoid introducing puns into the TrueCar product experience.</p>

    <span id="introductory-phrases"><a name="introductory-phrases"></a></span>
        <h2>Omit Common Introductory Phrases</h2>

<h5>Example:</h5>

        <aside class="example">

            <p class="good"><em>Enter your VIN to get started</em></p>

            <p class="bad"><em>You must enter your VIN to get started</em></p>

        </aside>
   <span id="serial-comma"> <a name="serial-comma"></a></span>
        <h2>Avoid the Serial Comma</h2>

<h5>Example:</h5>

<aside class="example">

        <p class="good"><em>See what others paid, get real prices on actual cars and work with America's top-rated dealers.</em></p>

        <p class="bad"><em>See what others paid, get real prices on actual cars, and work with America's top-rated dealers.</em></p>

</aside>
    <span id="adverbs"><a name="adverbs"></a></span>
        <h2>Omit Adverbs Wherever Possible</h2>

<p>There are times when adverbs are unavoidable. But, more often than not, you can remove them, or a sentence can be re-written to exclude them, without losing the message.</p>

<h5>Exclusion example:</h5>

        <aside class="example">

            <p class="good"><em>To get your True Cash Offer, find your VIN and click the link below.</em></p>

            <p class="bad"><em>To get your True Cash Offer, simply find your VIN and click the link below.</em></p>

        </aside>

<h5> Rewritten example:</h5>

        <aside class="example">

            <p class="good"><em>You can redeem your True Cash Offer by dropping your car off at your local dealer.</em></p>

            <p class="bad"><em>You can redeem your True Cash Offer by dropping your car off locally at the dealership.</em></p>

        </aside>
    <!-- <span id="ampersands"><a name="ampersands"></a></span>
        <h2>Ampersands</h2>
        <p>Ampersands are acceptable in button copy and navigational elements. Anywhere character economy is a top concern.</p>

<h5>Example:</h5>

        <aside class="example">

<p class="good"><em>View Real Prices &amp; Inventory</em></p>

<p class="bad"><em>View Real Prices and Inventory</em></p>

            </aside> -->
        <span id="exclamation-points"><a name="exclamation-points"></a></span>
            <h2>Exclamation Points</h2>

<p>Exclamation points should be used when a statement is exceptional or rare. Overusing the exclamation point reduces its impact. When everything is exceptional, nothing is exceptional.</p>

        <h5>Example:</h5>

        <aside class="example">

                <p class="good"><em>You may be eligible for an additional $10,000 in savings!</em></p>

                <p class="bad"><em>The list below includes additional incentives that may increase your savings total. Select all that apply!</em></p>
            </aside>

<span id="titles"> <a name="titles"></a></span>

<h2>Headings</h2>


<p>When capitalizing headings, the <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em> is your guide. For all else, we generally defer to the <em>Associated Press Stylebook</em>.</p> 

<p>Headings from h1 to h2 should be capitalized using title case. Headings h3 through h6 should be written out in sentence case. </p>

<h5>Example:</h5>

<aside class="example"> 

<p class="good">We Found Four In-stock Matches for You</p>

</aside>

<p>We also use title capitalization in button copy, CTA copy and navigational hyperlinks. </p>

<p>Certain exceptions to this rule do exist.</p>
<p>For example, when listing out the items in a vehicle price breakdown, using title case for all the listed items is acceptable. </p>

<h5>Example: </h5>

<aside class="example">

<ul id="price-breakdown">
<li><b>MSRP Breakdown</b></li>
<br>
<li>Base MSRP: $51,700</li>
<li>Factory Installed Options: $3,200</li>
<li>Freight Delivery Charge: $995</li>
<br>
<li><b>Total MSRP: $55,895</b></li>
</ul>

</aside>


<p>Title case is all about creating a hierarchy of information. </p>

<p>If you find a use case that doesn't fit these examples, ask yourself if you want any of the information you're writing to be at the top of a hierarchy. </p>

<p>If you <em>do want</em> a sentence or list item to be at the top of a hierarchy, then that sentence or list item should be capitalized using title case.</p>


        <br />
        <p><em><b>Summary:</b> Know what you're writing about, but don't be a jerk about it.</em></p>
        <br />
                <p>We've designed the TrueCar experience to give confidence to the user. The user must feel that the information they are seeing is transparent and accurate.</p>

                <p>We achieve this feeling only if we use a steady and consistent tone of voice. Confident but never cocky.</p>
        <span id="active-voice"><a name="active-voice"></a></span>
            <h2>Write in Active Voice</h2>

                <p>TrueCar users want reassurance that they are owning the process of using TrueCar. Writing in an active voice empowers the user and adds to TrueCar's authority.</p>

        <h5>Example:</h5>

        <aside class="example">

                <p class="good"><em>You can find your VIN (17 characters) in two places on your vehicle.</em></p>

                <p class="bad"><em>Your VIN (17 characters) can be located in two places on your vehicle.</em></p>
        </aside>
        <span id="second-person"><a name="second-person"></a></span>
            <h2>Address the User in the Second Person</h2>

                <p>When addressing a user in a personalized experience, we use the pronouns "your" or "yours." This possessive pronoun usage has a dual purpose: It brings a feeling of personalization into the experience, and it introduces a stronger sense of ownership.</p>

        <h5>Example:</h5>

        <aside class="example">

                <p class="good"><em>Here is the Price Report for your 2017 Nissan Altima</em></p>

                <p class="bad"><em>Here is the Price Report for a 2017 Nissan Altima</em></p>
        </aside>

                <p>The exception to this rule: You may use the first person possessive pronoun "My" as a navigation element when you are trying to describe an element i.e. "My Account."</p>

                <p>However, when you are writing descriptive copy to describe this element, never mix "my / mine" with "you / your" as it can cause confusion.</p>

    <span id="first-person"><a name="first-person"></a></span>
            <h2>Avoid First Person Pronouns</h2>


            <p>TrueCar user experience copy should focus on the benefit to the user. Using first person pronouns "I" or "We" diminishes this emphasis. TrueCar is seldom "doing" something for the user. The user is discovering things for themselves.</p>

            <h5>Example:</h5>

        <aside class="example">

            <p class="good"><em>There are three dealers with eight offers ready for your review.</em></p>

            <p class="bad"><em>We have found three dealers with eight offers ready for your review.</em></p>

        </aside>
     <!--    <span id="partners"><a name="partners"></a></span>
            <h2>Copywriting Guidelines for Partners:</h2>


            <p>If a partner adheres to a different style guide, use that style guide in place of this one.</p>

            <p>If the partner does not have a style guide, use this guide. Pay special attention to the consistency of voice between the partner and TrueCar.</p> -->


<h2>Using the Word "vehicle" Versus the Phrase "Car or Truck."</h2>

<p>Early in the TrueCar experience, before the user has prospected, write out the phrase "car or truck" when talking about vehicles to a new user.</p>

            <h5>Example:</h5>

        <aside class="example">

            <p class="good"><em>Use TrueCar to see what others paid for their car or truck.</em></p>

            <p class="bad"><em>Use TrueCar to see what others paid for their vehicle.</em></p>

        </aside>
<p>Once the user has configured their car or truck, use the word "vehicle" in place of the phrase "car or truck."</p>

<p>If we can tell the difference, from a technology standpoint, whether the user is looking at a car or truck, be sure to note that in the copy. A truck is not a car, as any truck driver will tell you. Acknowledging the difference makes for a more enriched user experience.</p>

                <h5>Example:</h5>


        <aside class="example">
            <p class="good"><em>You have configured your 2017 Ford F-150, and the truck is waiting for you at the Steve Harvey Ford Dealership in Colorado Springs, CO.</em></p>

            <p class="bad"><em>You have configured your 2017 Ford F-150, and the vehicle is waiting for you at the Steve Harvey Ford Dealership in Colorado Springs, CO.</em></p>
        </aside>

<p>Again, if we are not able to determine whether the user has configured a car or truck, you may use the word "vehicle" instead.</p>
