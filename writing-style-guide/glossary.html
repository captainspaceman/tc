<h2>Price Report</h2>

<p>The place where we show users what other people are paying for their vehicles.</p>

<p>Think of the price report page as a living thing.</p>

<p>Dealers across the country are feeding the price report data on how much they sold their cars for.</p>

<p>We take that data, clean it up, put it into a visualization ("The Curve") and show it to consumers.</p>


<h2>TrueCar Average</h2>

<p>The Price Report page describes the TrueCar average as:</p>

        
        <aside class="example">

<p><em>"The TrueCar Average for your selected vehicle is a proprietary mathematical
calculation based on actual recent transactions of TrueCar users. It provides an
understanding of what other TrueCar users have paid for similarly configured vehicles
    as compared to non-TrueCar users.</em></p>
    <p><em> local or national price ratio for each trim or
model is computed by normalizing savings across configurations by TrueCar users to all
other purchases. This ratio is then applied to the local Market Average to
derive the TrueCar Average for the configured vehicle. The TrueCar Average
is provided for informational purposes only.  It is not an offer or advertisement of
any price from any dealer."</em></p>
        </aside>


<p><em>"A proprietary mathematical calculation based on actual recent transactions of TrueCar users."</em></p>


<p>In English, that means that this is an average of "what others paid."</p>

<p>It is is the end result of 14,000 dealers sitting at their computers and telling us how much they sold their cars for.</p>

<p>Its important to note, the TrueCar Average is <em>not </em>an advertised price. For more on this, see "Minimum Allowable Advertised Price or M.A.A.P"</p>

<h2>Vehicle Identification Number</h2>

<p>A serial number for cars and trucks. Vehicle identification numbers (VIN) is a 17 digit numbers that is unique to a single car or truck.</p>

<p>No two are alike. Quite literally a "real car."</p>

<h2>VIN-Based Offers</h2>

<p>This is the "real price" on an "actual car" and it's kind of amazing when you think about it.</p>

<p>Car shoppers want to see the price of a real car. But find that information has historically been almost impossible without visiting the dealership.</p>

<p>TrueCar's VIN-based offers solve that problem. You're able to see pricing down to the VIN level the</p>
