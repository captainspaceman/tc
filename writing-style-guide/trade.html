    <h2>What is TrueCar Trade?</h2>

        <p>TrueCar Trade is the new, better way to sell or trade-in your car. It provides the most transparent, real-time valuation of your car in minutes. Users can actually see their car’s value go up or down based on its unique condition before receiving a True Cash Offer from up to three TrueCar Certified Dealers. The user chooses an offer, and brings their car in for a side by side check with the Dealer together, and then they can cash out or trade-in their car.</p>

<span id="how"><a name="how"></a></span>

    <h2>How does TrueCar Trade work?</h2>

        <p>You can sell or trade-in your car in three simple steps. First, go to TrueCar.com/Trade and enter details about your car to see in real-time how your car is valued. Second, you’ll receive a True Cash Offer from up to three TrueCar Certified Dealers. Last, bring your car in to your Dealer of choice and they will do a side-by-side check with you together, so you can cash out or trade-in.</p>

<span id="how-soon"><a name="how-soon"></a></span>

    <h2>How soon can I sell my vehicle?</h2>

        <p>As soon as you get your True Cash Offer sent to you, you can make an appointment with your Dealer of choice to sell your vehicle. Once you bring your car in for a quick side-by-side check, you can cash out or trade-in.</p>

<span id="how-long"><a name="how-long"></a></span>

    <h2>How long is my True Cash Offer valid for?</h2>

        <p>True Cash Offers are valid for 72 hours. Once it expires, you can still easily refresh your offer in minutes without having to enter all your information again, unless you are valuating a different vehicle.</p>

<span id="what-happens"><a name="what-happens"></a></span>

    <h2>What happens when I get to the Dealership?</h2>

        <p>When you bring your car in with your True Cash Offer, your Dealer will scan your offer so they have the same information as you do. Then, they will perform a side-by-side check of your car with you together. After that, your Dealer will give you the option to redeem your True Cash Offer, or trade-in your car for a new one.</p>

<span id="purchase"><a name="purchase"></a></span>

    <h2>Do I have to purchase a new vehicle in order to use your service?</h2>

        <p>No. Users may choose to simply sell their car. Once they receive their True Cash Offer, they can bring their car in and redeem their offer at the Dealership with no further obligation.</p>

<span id="how-different"><a name="how-different"></a></span>

    <h2>How is True Cash Offer different than the competitors?</h2>
        
        <p>Unlike other sites that give you a range for your car, only TrueCar gives you the most accurate, third-party back value that goes up and down in real-time based on your mileage, your trim, and your wear and tear. No one else shows you that level of detail. And when you bring your car into your TrueCar Certified Dealer, your Dealer will be with you the entire time checking your car with you together, so everyone is on the same page.</p>
