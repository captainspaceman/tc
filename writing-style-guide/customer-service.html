      <h1>Customer Service</h1>
    </div>

            <p>Social media, Itunes and Google Play are popular forums for TrueCar customers to voice their concerns. </p>

            <p>Being mindful of the old adage "the customer is always right" comes in handy when communicating with TrueCar customers. Follow these tenets of civil correspondence when dealing with any customer concerns. </p>


<span id="listen-first"><a name="listen-first"></a></span>

        <h2>Listen First</h2>

            <p>You can't help a customer through their problem unless you know what that problem is. Read through their entire complaint, then reach out to them apologizing that they didn't have a good experience. </p>

            <p>Always be sure that you understand the issue they are facing before you make any claims. </p>

<span id="practice-empathy"><a name="practice-empathy"></a></span>

        <h2>Practice Empathy</h2>

            <p>Customer service copywriting is all about practicing empathy.</p> 

            <p>Always make a genuine effort to let the customer know that you care, and that you are taking their concerns and complaints seriously.</p>

<span id="never-argue"><a name="never-argue"></a></span>

        <h2>Never Argue</h2>

            <p>The easiest way to turn a customer service engagement sour is to get angry, defensive or irritated with the Customer.</p>

            <p>The most important thing to keep in mind is to always try and see things from the customer's point of view. If a customer is complaining about TrueCar in public forum, then the chances are very good that they are already irritated to begin with. No use making it worse. </p>

<span id="dont-repeat-yourself"><a name="dont-repeat-yourself"></a></span>

        <h2>Don't Repeat Yourself</h2>

            <p>Prepared reponses to customer concerns can be very useful if you're dealing with a common issue.</p>

            <p>However, sometimes this can lead to robot-like copywriting where you're saying the same thing over and over. Not ideal. </p>

            <p>Here are some example apologetic greetings that you can have prepared when you're trying to engage a customer.</p>

        <aside class="example">

                <p class="bad">Hi Bill, we're sorry you didn't have a great experience.</p>

                <p class="bad">Hi Ron, we're sorry you didn't have a great experience.</p>

                <p class="bad">Hi Sally, we're sorry you didn't have a great experience.</p>

                <p class="good">Hi (First Name), so sorry you didn't have a good experience.</p>

                <p class="good">Hi (First Name), sorry to hear that, we work hard to give every user the best experience we can. </p>

                <p class="good">Hi (First Name), we have to apologize that you didn't have a good experience. </p>

                <p class="good">Hi (First Name), we're sorry you didn't find what you were looking for, maybe we can help. Can you call our customer service center at (888) 878-3227?</p>

                <p class="good">Hi (First Name), we're sorry you didn't have a good experience when using the app.</p> 

                <p class="good">Hi (First Name), we're sorry you didn't have a great time using the app.</p>

                <p class="good">Hi (First Name), sounds like you didn't have a great experience with the app, and for that we're very sorry. </p>

                <p class="good">Hi (First Name), it seems like you weren't able to get the most out of your experience with the app. We're very sorry about that, is there anything we can do to help? </p>

                <p class="good">Hi (First Name), sorry you had a bad experience with the product. We'd like the opportunity to make it up to you. Can you give us a call at (888) 878-3227?</p>

                <p class="good">Hi (First Name), we're very sorry to hear that! Can you give us a call at (888) 878-3227 so we can address this with you directly?</p>

                <p class="good">Hi (First Name), sorry to hear that you didn't have a good time using the app.</p> 

                <p class="good">Hi (First Name), we're very sorry to hear that you had a bad experience. Can you call us at (888) 878-3227?</p> 

                <p class="good">Hi (First Name), we're sad to hear that you didn't have a great experience. If there's anything we can do to help please don't hesitate to call us at (888) 878-3227.</p>

                <p class="good">Hi (First Name), sorry your experience using the product wasn't all you'd hoped for. Give us a call at (888) 878-3227 and we'll see if we can make it up to you. </p>

        </aside>

<span id="send-them-to-cs"><a name="send-them-to-cs"></a></span>

        <h2>Send them to CS</h2>

            <p>It's best not to try and drag out a conversation on social media or in an app store. The most effective way to solve a customer service issue is to direct it to our excellent customer service department (888) 878-3227. </p>

            <p>Message the number to the user and ask if they can give us a call. </p>
