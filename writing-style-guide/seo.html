      <h1>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h1>
    </div>


    <span id="how-it-works"><a name="how-it-works"></a></span>

    <h2>How it Works</h2>

        <p>Writing for search engine optimization is guided by this principle:</p>

            <section class="example">

        <p>"Every webpage should try to be the authority on <em>one single</em> question or topic."</p>

            </section>

        <p>Every page you write on TrueCar should strive to be the authority on one thing, and one thing only.</p>

        <h5>Only one thing? That sounds dumb. Why?</h5>

        <p>Good question, and the answer lies in the simplicity of search engine technology. At its core, a search engine is just a big index that stores, sorts and displays webpages when commanded by a user. </p>

        <p>The search engine "collects" these webpages using "crawlers," that go from webpage to webpage, storing and cataloging as they go. </p>

        <p><em>Google calls their crawler "Googlebot." Cute, huh?</em></p>

        <p>Once a web page is in a search engine's index, a user can retrieve that page by using search commands or "keywords."</p>

        <p>Enter a keyword into the search engine, it'll give you a webpage about that keyword. </p>

        <p>That "keyword" is your "one-thing" that your copy should be devoted to—contextually speaking</p>

        <p>There are <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=allintitle%3Aseo&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS715US717&oq=allintitle%3Aseo&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.11742j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">millions of blogs</a> about why and how the search engines keep on a' running. For the sake of this guide, we're going to focus on how to write so we don't gum up the gears.</p>

    <span id="keywords"><a name="keywords"></a></span>

    <h2>Keywords</h2>

            <p>Keywords are user questions, nothing more. A user asks a question of the search engine in the form of a query, and the search engine's algorithm gives the users the smartest answer it can muster—in the form of a webpage. </p>

            <p>These questions come in three types:</p>

            <section class="example">

                    <p><strong>1. Informational:</strong> A user wants to know something about a thing.</p> 
                    <p><strong>2. Navigational:</strong> A user wants to find out where a thing is.</p>
                    <p><strong>3. Transactional:</strong> A user wants to buy, get or acquire a thing.</p>

                </ul>

            </section>

            <h3>1. Informational</h3>

            <p>a user wants to "know" something about a thing. This is usually a user who is in the high-funnel "research" phase of car-buying. They're just asking questions and kicking the tires. Good folks. </p>

                <section class="example">

                    <p>"How does the 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee Handle?"</p>

                    <p>"What is the MPG of the 2018 Toyota Prius"</p>

                    <p>"What happened to Scion?"</p>
                
                </section>

        <h3>2. Navigational: </h3>

            <p>A user is curious to know where to find something. That "something" may be a Jeep dealership. It may also be the address of a delicious Thai restaurant, or the location of the nearest Bob's Big Boy... food dominates this category of search. People are hungry. </p>

                <section class="example">
                    <p>"Where is the nearest Jeep Dealer?"</p>
                    <p>"Jeep dealer near me"</p>
                    <p>"Thai food near me with a decent rating."</p>
                </section>


        <h3>3. Transactional: </h3>

            <p>This is a category of search that usually means a user is ready to buy a thing. They've kicked the tires, they've found the local dealers and now they want to get down to brass tax. This is the most interested of category of searchers. </p>

                <section class="example">
                    <p>"2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee Pricing"</p>
                    <p>"Lease a 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee"</p>
                    <p>"Buy a Jeep Grand Cherokee"</p>
                </section>

        <p>Bottom line: If you're writing a webpage on a specific topic, don't focus too hard on keywords.</p>

        <p>Focus on providing useful answers to a user's questions. Knowing how those questions are categorized will help you know how to answer those questions...</p>

        <p>And knowing, is half the battle.</p>

        <p>Answer correctly what we are referencing in the above sentence and I'll give you a $50 Amazon gift card, or a solid handshake—depending on availability.<a href="mailto:rfarrell@truecar.com?Subject=I won, gimme." target="_top">Here's my email.</a></p>

    <span id="keyword-stuffing"><a name="keyword-stuffing"></a></span>
            <h2>Keyword Stuffing</h2>
                    <p>Excellent organic visibility through search is essential to TrueCar's success. However, a good user experience is a paramount concern. Never stuff a page with keywords. The search engines no longer reward such behavior, and it makes for a bad user experience.</p>

                    <p>A good rule to abide by is to stick to one topic per page and write about that topic in a natural way.</p>

                        <h5>Example:</h5>
                            <p>If you were writing content on the topic of "Electronic stability control."</p>

                                <aside class="example">

                                    <p class="good"><em>Electronic stability control (ESC) is a computer-controlled safety feature that works by detecting and reducing vehicle traction loss. If ESC determines that your car is losing traction, the computerized system will help correct the problem by applying the brake to the appropriate wheel at exactly the right time. ESC may also decelerate if necessary. Saving your car, and possibly your life.</em></p>

                                    <p class="bad"><em>Electronic stability control is a computer controlled electronic stability control safety feature that works by detecting and reducing vehicle traction loss with electronic stability control. If electronic stability control determines that your car is losing traction, electronic stability control will help correct the problem by applying the brake to the appropriate wheel at exactly the right time. Electronic stability control may also decelerate if necessary because it is really good at electronic stability control. Saving your car, and possibly your life. Thank you, electronic stability control.</em></p>

                                </aside>

<span id="title-tags"><a name="title-tags"></a></span>
                <h2>Title Tags</h2>
                    <p>Title tags are webpage labels that live in the "head" section of an html document. They are, arguably, the most important part of a document for SEO—as far as writing goes.</p>

                    <p>Because a title tag the keyword optimized label for any one given webpage page, it tells the search engines what the page is about.</p>    

                    <p>Each page should have a unique title tag that's relevant to the page's topic.</p>

                    <h5>Example:</h5>
                            <p>If you were writing a title tag for the TrueCar homepage.</p>

                                <aside class="example">

                                    <p class="good">Car Prices & Inventory | Savings on New & Used Cars | TrueCar"</p>


                                    <p class="bad">"TrueCar.com"</p>

                                </aside>

                    <p>The search engines will usually only show the first 60 or so characters of any given title. So while a title tag could be longer than 60 characters, anything over 60 won't show up in the search engine results page. </p>


                    <p>If your title goes over the search engine's character limit, it will get cut off by ellipses, and nobody will ever know what you were trying to say. </p>


                                <aside class="example">

                                    <p class="good">Car Prices & Inventory | Savings on New & Used Cars | TrueCar</p>

                                    <p class="bad">"Car Prices and Inventory | Guaranteed Savings on Great New and Used..."</p>

                                </aside>

                    <p>So keep it short, you've got precious real estate to work with. The ampersands is your friend here. Also, don't feel the need to add unnecessary adjectives or adverbs. </p>
