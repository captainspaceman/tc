<p>Excellent organic visibility through search is essential to TrueCar's success. However, a good user experience is a paramount concern. Never stuff a page with keywords. The search engines no longer reward such behavior, and it makes for a bad user experience.</p>

            <p>A good rule to abide by is to stick to one topic per page and write about that topic in a natural way.</p>

            <h5>Example:</h5>
                <p>If you were writing content on the topic of "Electronic stability control."</p>

        <aside class="example">

            <p class="good"><em>Electronic stability control (ESC) is a computer-controlled safety feature that works by detecting and reducing vehicle traction loss. If ESC determines that your car is losing traction, the computerized system will help correct the problem by applying the brake to the appropriate wheel at exactly the right time. ESC may also decelerate if necessary. Saving your car, and possibly your life.</em></p>

            <p class="bad"><em>Electronic stability control is a computer controlled electronic stability control safety feature that works by detecting and reducing vehicle traction loss with electronic stability control. If electronic stability control determines that your car is losing traction, electronic stability control will help correct the problem by applying the brake to the appropriate wheel at exactly the right time. Electronic stability control may also decelerate if necessary because it is really good at electronic stability control. Saving your car, and possibly your life. Thank you, electronic stability control.</em></p>

        </aside>
