     <div class="blue-box">
      <span id="one"><a name="one"></a></span>
      <h1>Various Style Rules</h1>
    </div>

        <span id="periods"><a name="periods"></a></span>
            <h2>The Rule on Periods, Period.</h2>
                <p>Only one space after a period before starting the next sentence.</p>

        <span id="headlines"><a name="headlines"></a></span>
            <h2>Headlines</h2>
                <p>Always title casing. No periods at the end of the headline (unless it's a two-sentence headline).</p>

                    <aside class="example">
                      <p>Example 1: A New Way to Buy a Car</p>
                      <p>Example 2: A New Way to Buy a Car. A Great Way to Save Money.</p>
                    </aside>

                <p><a href="http://titlecapitalization.com">'Titlecapitalization.com'</a> is your co-pilot, the <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em> is your guide&mdash;but only for headlines. For all else, we generally defer to the <em>Associated Press Stylebook</em>.</p>

        <span id="subheadlines"><a name="subheadlines"></a></span>
            <h2>Subheadlines</h2>
                <p>Regular casing. As with headlines, no periods at the end of the subheadline unless it has two sentences.</p>

        <span id="abbreviations"><a name="abbreviations"></a></span>
            <h2>Abbreviations and Acronyms</h2>
                <p>If it's possible a reader won't understand or recognize an abbreviation or acronym, then spell it out, at least the first time it's used, then add the acronym with parentheses. If it's a widely known abbreviation&mdash;say, DVD or FYI&mdash;then the short form is fine.</p>

        <span id="ampersands"><a name="ampersands"></a></span>
            <h2>Ampersands</h2>
                <p>We can live without ampersands, with three exceptions: ampersands are acceptable in button, navigation or meta data copy for character efficiency.</p>

        <span id="asterisks"><a name="asterisks"></a></span>
            <h2>Asterisks</h2>
                <p>As a rule, asterisks tend to denote dishonesty&mdash;as in the first thing your brain says when it sees one is, &ldquo;I knew there was a catch.&rdquo; However, if you must use them (as is often the case when dealing with, say, &ldquo;save up to&rdquo;offers), just remember there's nothing to hide. Translation, don't follow up your asterisk with &ldquo;small print.&rdquo;</p>

        <span id="bullets"><a name="bullets"></a></span>
            <h2>Bullets</h2>
                <p>When using bullets, make sure they answer the lead-in copy and that there are no periods at the end (unless it's comprised of two or more sentences). The opening of each bullet should ideally be a verb.</p>
                    
                        <aside class="example">
                          <p>TrueCar allows you to:</p>
                              <ul>
                                <li>Buy with confidence</li>
                                <li>Get a great deal on a car. You'll even get locked-in savings.</li>
                                <li>See what others paid for the car you want</li>
                              </ul>
                        </aside>

        <span id="capitalization"><a name="capitalization"></a></span>

            <h2>Capitalization</h2>

                <p>Knowing which words to capitalize and which words not to can be a headache&mdash; especially with so many stakeholders involved. In general, use common sense. However, some specific guidelines: Important words like names, organizations, and events should always be capitalized, and always capitalize the customers that drive our business – &ldquo;Dealers.&rdquo; This applies to "TrueCar Certified Dealers" and "Dealers" who haven&#39;t joined our network. Use lower-casing for "dealerships," unless referring to a "TrueCar Certified Dealership."</p>

        <span id="citations-and-stats"><a name="citations-and-stats"></a></span>
            
            <h2>Citations and Stats </h2>

                <p>If you quote a source or throw down a stat, you'll often need to site your source. When you do, here's how you'll need to format it (based on the <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em>). Use this for slide presentations, print ads, and collateral. <em>Author First Name Last Name, Publication or Organization, &ldquo;Title,&rdquo; Month Year</em></p>


                    

                        <aside class="example">

                            <p>Derrick Feldmann, Achieve, &ldquo;Inspiring the Next Generation Workforce: The 2014 Millennial Impact Report,&rdquo; June 2014</p>

                        </aside>

                            <p>If no author is listed, start with the organization</p>

                        <aside class="example">

                            <p>comScore, &ldquo;The U.S. Mobile App Report,&rdquo; August 2014</p>

                        </aside>

                            <p>If there are multiple authors, list the first and add &ldquo;et al.&rdquo;:</p>

                        <aside class="example">

                            <p>Julie Bezerra, et al., Boston Consulting Group, &ldquo;The Mobile Revolution: How Mobile Technologies Drive a Trillion-Dollar Impact,&rdquo; January 2015</p>

                        </aside>

                            <p>If space is limited, use one of the formats below:</p>

                        <aside class="example">

                          <p>Boston Consulting Group, &ldquo;The Mobile Revolution: How Mobile Technologies Drive a Trillion-Dollar Impact,&rdquo; January 2015</p>

                          <p>Boston Consulting Group, &ldquo;The Mobile Revolution: How Mobile Technologies Drive a Trillion-Dollar Impact,&rdquo; Jan. 2015</p>

                          <p>Boston Consulting Group, Jan. 2015</p>

                          <p>Boston Consulting Group</p>

                        </aside>

        <span id="commas"><a name="commas"></a></span>
            <h2>Commas</h2>
                <p>We're selective about how we use the Oxford comma. We try to avoid it.</p>
                     
                        <aside class="example">
                          <p>I bake cookies that are gluten-free, soy-free, wheat-free and taste-free.</p>
                        </aside>
                            <p>But, sometimes it's necessary. If you read the sentence out loud and need to pause for a breath, chances are it needs a comma.</p>

        <span id="company-labels"><a name="company-labels"></a></span>

            <h2>Company Names and Products</h2>
                <p>Check companies' official websites to find their preferred conventions.</p>

                <p>The first mention of a company or product can be with its name. After that, start finding other ways to describe it. For example once you've said TrueCar the first time, start referring to us as &ldquo;we&rdquo; or &ldquo;our.&rdquo;</p>

        <span id="contractions"><a name="contractions"></a></span>

            <h2>Contractions</h2>
                <p>Contractions make us sound friendly and human!</p>
                    
                        <aside class="example">
                          <p>&ldquo;We're&rdquo;</p>
                          <p>instead of
                            <p>
                              <p>&ldquo;We are.&rdquo;</p>
                        </aside>

        <span id="data"><a name="data"></a></span>
            <h2>Data</h2>
                <p>Treat &ldquo;data&rdquo; as singular.</p>
                    
                        <aside class="example">
                            <p>The data shows that...</p>
                        </aside>

        <span id="dates"><a name="dates"></a></span>
            <h2>Dates</h2>
                <p>Spell out the day and the month.</p>

                        <aside class="example">
                          <p>My training as a rodeo cowboy began on Sunday, January 24.</p>
                        </aside>

        <span id="ellipses"><a name="ellipses"></a></span>
            <h2>Ellipses</h2>
                <p>In general, we don't use them. But if you must here's the example:</p>

                        <aside class="example">  
                            <p>It's a right of passage when you get your driver's license … you gain independence … freedom.</p>
                        </aside>


                <p>We use three dots and space once before they begin and once after they end.</p>

    <h2>Em Dashes</h2>
    <p>
      Use an em dash (&mdash;) without spaces to set off a parenthetical statement (yes, we had to look it up the first time, too). Don't use two hyphens in place of an em dash.</p>

    
    <aside class="example">
      <p>Writing straightforward, clear copy isn't as easy as you'd imagine&mdash;especially if you're used to writing for companies that don't place as high an emphasis on transparency.</p>
    </aside>

                <h2>En Dashes</h2>
                <p>
                  Wider than a hyphen but shorter than an Em Dash. It's used between ranges of numbers or dates: 2005–2015, pages 25–64, and between two-word adjectives: &ldquo;I'm taking the LAX–NYC flight.&rdquo; There are no spaces before or after the en dash.</p>

                <h2>Exclamation Points</h2>

                <p>Use judiciously. Should indicate that something is exceptional or rare.</p>

                <h2>Flagrant Formatting</h2>
                <p>
                  The meaning of your words should come through without the use of italics, bold, caps, and underline. If you absolutely feel that you <em>MUST </em>flagrantly format, work it out with the designer or creative director.</p>

                <h2>Hyphens</h2>
                <p>
                  When you take two different words and combine them to make an adjective (i.e. values-based, purpose-driven, hyper-connected, gluten-free) you should use a hyphen.</p>
