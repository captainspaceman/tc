<p>Itunes and Google Play are popular forums for TrueCar customers to voice their concerns.</p>

<p>Being mindful of the old adage "the customer is always right" comes in handy when communicating with TrueCar customers in these two forums. Follow these tenets of civil correspondence when dealing with any customer concerns.</p>

<h2>Listen First</h2>

<p>You can't help a customer through their problem unless you know what that problem is. Read through their entire complaint, then reach out to them, apologize that they didn't have a good experience and try and see if you can help them along.</p>

<p>Always be sure that you understand the issue a user is facing before you make any claims or offer any instructions.</p>

<h2>Practice Empathy</h2>

<p>Customer service copywriting is all about practicing empathy.</p>

<p>Always make a genuine effort to let the customer know that you care, and that you are taking their concerns and complaints seriously.</p>

<h2>Never Argue</h2>

<p>The easiest way to turn a customer service engagement sour is to become angry or defensive.</p>

<p>The most important thing to keep in mind is to always try and see things from the customer's point of view. If a customer is complaining about TrueCar in a public forum, then the chances are very good that they are already irritated to begin with.</p>

<p>If you get angry, they'll get more angry. And then nobody wins.</p>

<h2>Don't Repeat Yourself</h2>

<p>Prepared reponses to customer concerns can be very useful if you're dealing with a common issue.</p>

<p>However, sometimes this can lead to robot-like copywriting where you're saying the same thing over and over. Not ideal.</p>

<p>Here are some example apologetic greetings that you can have prepared when you're trying to engage a customer.</p>

<p>Hi Bill, we're sorry you didn't have a great experience.</p>

<p>Hi Ron, we're sorry you didn't have a great experience.</p>
