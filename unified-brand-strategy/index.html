                                <h1>Get the TruePrice—the Actual Price You Will Pay at the Dealership.</h1>

                                <h3>Right Car, Better Price</h3>

                                <p>It’s a question on every car shopper’s mind: “How do I know that the price I see on this car is a good price?” There hasn't been a great answer to this question, until now.</p>

                                <p>With TrueCar, a Certified Dealer gives you an upfront, discounted price that includes all fees, accessory costs and incentives. This is your TruePrice, the price you’ll pay at the dealership. Better than the price you will find on other websites, backed by data, and transparent down to the last detail.</p>

                                <h3>Compare. Select. Save.</h3>

                                <p>TruePrice is better because over 15,000 dealers uniquely set the price in TrueCar knowing you will see their prices alongside what other people paid.</p>

                                <p>Our dealers know all about the TrueCar Price Curve—they can see it when they set their pricing. Because of the curve, they price their vehicles competitively so they won't lose your business.</p>

                                <h3>A Price Curve for Every Car</h3>

                                <p>Every vehicle on TrueCar has a unique price curve data visualization that shows you what your neighbors paid for that same car: make, model, color and style.</p>

                                <p>This curve comes from our detailed analysis of millions of sales transactions from across the United States. Finally, you can cut through the numerical clutter of car buying and view a single validated price on the exact car or truck you want.<p>

                                <h3>Trusted to Deliver the TruePrice</h3>

                                <p>Since the very beginning, TrueCar has partnered with some of the largest membership organizations in the country, including USAA, Sam's Club, and American Express, giving members who use TrueCar a superior car-buying experience.</p>

They will be tripping over themselves to offer you a great price on just the car you’re looking for. Which, assuming you’re ready to buy, is fantastic. If you’re not quite ready yet, that’s OK too. Just maybe hold off on this part of the process until you’re ready to roll. Figuratively speaking. But also, now that we think about it, literally speaking as well.</mark> </p>
