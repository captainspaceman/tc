                                <h3>Right Car, Better Price</h3>

                                <p>It’s a question on every car shopper’s mind: “How do I know that the price I see on this car is a good price?” There hasn't been a great answer to this question, until now.</p>

                                <p>With TrueCar, a Certified Dealer gives you an upfront, discounted price that includes all fees, accessory costs and incentives. This is your TruePrice, the price you’ll pay at the dealership. Better than the price you will find on other websites, backed by data, and transparent down to the last detail.</p>

                                <h3>Compare. Select. Save.</h3>

                                <p>Our dealers know all about the TrueCar Price Curve — they can see it when they set their pricing. Because of the curve, they price their vehicles competitively to win your business and give you a better experience.</p>
