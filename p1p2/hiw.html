<h5>Expansive Version</h5>

<h3>A Better Price</h3>

<p>With TrueCar, a certified dealer gives you an upfront, discounted price that includes all fees, accessory costs, and incentives. This is your TruePrice—the price you’ll pay at the dealership.</p>

<h3>Dealers Compete, You Compare</h3>

<p>TruePrice is better because over 15,000 dealers uniquely set the price in TrueCar knowing you will see their prices alongside what other people paid. They price to get your business.</p>

<h3>Shop at Your Own Pace</h3>

<p>No more unwanted emails or phone calls. Control dealer communication levels from within your account. Dealer contact happens on your terms—and only when you're ready.</p>
