<h3>Right Car, Better Price</h3>

<p>It’s a question on every car shopper’s mind: “How do I know that the price I see on this car is a good price?” There hasn't been a great answer to this question, until now.</p>

<p>With TrueCar, a Certified Dealer gives you an upfront, discounted price that includes all fees, accessory costs and incentives. This is your TruePrice, the price you’ll pay at the dealership. Better than the price you will find on other websites, backed by data, and transparent down to the last detail.</p>

<h5>V1.a</h5>

<h3>Shop For a Car In Peace</h3>

<p>No more fending off unwanted emails or phone calls from dealers. Browse dealer inventory, view pricing—including fees and accessory costs—and compare your price to what your neighbors paid in the peace of your own home. Then, when you're ready, contact a local TrueCar Certified Dealership to schedule a test drive. </p>

<h5>v1.b</h5>

<h3>Car Shopping Without the Noise</h3>

<p>No more fending off unwanted emails or phone calls from dealers. Control dealer communication levels from within your account, browse inventory, view pricing—including fees and accessory costs—all in the peace of your own home.</p> 

<p>Then, when you're ready, you can contact a local TrueCar Certified Dealership to schedule a test drive.</p>

<h3>Dealers Compete, You Compare</h3>

<p>TruePrice is better because over 15,000 dealers uniquely set the price in TrueCar knowing you will see their prices alongside what other people paid.</p>

<p>Our dealers know all about the TrueCar Price Curve—they can see it when they set their pricing. Because of the curve, they price their vehicles competitively so they won't lose your business.</p>

<h3>A Price Curve for Every Car</h3>

<p>Every vehicle on TrueCar has a unique price curve data visualization that shows you what your neighbors paid for that same car: make, model, color and style.</p>

<p>This curve comes from our detailed analysis of millions of sales transactions from across the United States. Finally, you can cut through the numerical clutter of car buying and view a single validated price on the exact car or truck you want.</p>

<h3>Trusted to Deliver the TruePrice</h3>

<p>Since the very beginning, TrueCar has partnered with some of the largest membership organizations in the country, including USAA, Sam's Club, and American Express, giving members who use TrueCar a superior car-buying experience.</p>
