<p>Dear Mr. Farrell, </p>

<p>Now that you're shopping for a new vehicle, it’s important that you know the value of your trade-in so you can apply it towards the purchase of your new car or truck.</p>

<p>Now that you're shopping for a new vehicle, it’s important that you know the value of your trade-in so you can apply it towards your new car or truck.</p>

<p>While more goes into valuing a used vehicle that we can outline here, did you know that wear and tear usually falls into one of two categories? </p>

<h2>Two Categories of Wear and Tear</h2> 

<h3>Minor</h3>

<p>Small surface dings, scratches or cracks. Tire wear consistent with the mileage. No mechanical or electrical issues.</p>

<h3>Excessive</h3> 

<p>Large dings, scratches or cracks that would be expensive to repair. Major mechanical or electrical issues. Missing parts.</p>

<p>If you only have minor wear and tear, and everything else is in order, then you might be pleasantly surpirsed at the trade-in value you’ll get towards your purchase of a new vehicle. </p>

    <h5>V1. DIY Car Improvement - V1 Crafted 1092017 - Pre-Approval</h5>

    <p>Dear Mr. Farrell, </p>

<p>Now that you're shopping for a new vehicle, it’s important that you know the value of your trade-in so you can apply it towards the purchase of your new car or truck.</p>

<p>We have a few tips to maximize the value of your used car, so you can get the most out of it when it's time to trade-up.</p>

<h5>Get it detailed</h5>

<p>A professional detailing service can have a car with minor wear and tear looking almost new. If you're the DIY type, you can tackle this task yourself if you've got the time. 

<h5>Get it serviced</h5>

<p>An oil change, a tire rotation plus all the little ins and outs of routine car maintenance can add up to a more valuable trade-in when it's time to turn in the keys. </p>

<p>Once you've covered the basics, you can use our trade-estimate tool to find the actual residual value of your car.</p>
