<p>Dear Mr. Farrell, </p>

<p>Now that you're shopping for a new vehicle, it’s important that you know the value of your trade-in so you can apply it towards the purchase of your new car or truck.</p>

<p>Now that you're shopping for a new vehicle, it’s important that you know the value of your trade-in so you can apply it towards your new car or truck.</p>

<p>While more goes into valuing a used vehicle that we can outline here, did you know that wear and tear usually falls into one of two categories? </p>

<h2>Two Categories of Wear and Tear</h2> 

<h3>Minor</h3>

<p>Small surface dings, scratches or cracks. Tire wear consistent with the mileage. No mechanical or electrical issues.</p>

<h3>Excessive</h3> 

<p>Large dings, scratches or cracks that would be expensive to repair. Major mechanical or electrical issues. Missing parts.</p>

<p>If you only have minor wear and tear, and everything else is in order, then you might be pleasantly surpirsed at the trade-in value you’ll get towards your purchase of a new vehicle. </p>
