    <h5>V1. Dealer Fees - V1 Crafted 01112017 - Pre-Approval</h5>


<p>Dear Mr. Farrell, </p>

<p>With the USAA Car Buying Service, you get to see all of the fees you will pay at the Dealership before you even visit the lot. </p>

<p>What are dealer fees, you ask? Good question. The answer can vary depending on many factors, but some of the more common fees you're likely to see are:</p>

<p><strong>1. Tax, Title and License Fee:</strong> Taxes vary from state to state, title fees show proof of ownership and license fees are so you can legally drive the vehicle. </p>

<p><strong>2. Dealer Documentation Fee:</strong> Also known as "Doc Fee," this fee is a service charge the dealership adds for the paperwork they have do on your behalf. </p>

<p><strong>3. Destination Fee:</strong> A shipping fee that the manufacturer charges the dealership to transport the car to the lot. The dealer then passes this onto the consumer. </p>

<p>There are other fees that you may encounter when its time to purchase, but by using the USAA Car Buying Service you can view them all up front, so you know you're getting a fair deal. </p>
