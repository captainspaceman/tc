    <h2>We Get It. We F*cked Up. We're Fixing It.</h2>

<p>At TrueCar, our goal has always been to provide car buyers with the best possible experience. To put the power of pricing transparency into the hands of the consumer. To “fix” the car-buying business for good…</p>

<p>Boy, did we blow that one.</p>


<p>The good news? We heard you, and we’re fixing our product to meet your demands. </p>

<p>No more fending off unwanted emails or phone calls from dealers. No more spam, no more contact from out of the blue. You will now have full control over communication from dealers.</p> 

<p>All the features that make TrueCar great will still be available to you: browse dealer inventory, view pricing—including fees and accessory costs—and compare your price to what your neighbors paid in the peace of your own home. </p>

<p>Then, when you're ready, you can contact a local TrueCar Certified Dealership to schedule a test drive.</p>

<p>No noise, no annoyances, and no hassles—the way car buying should be.</p>

<p>And this time we MEAN it.</p>
