<p>Dear Mr. Farrell</p>

<p>Thank you for using the USAA Car Buying Service, powered by TRUECar. </p>

<p>We bet you're pretty excited to go car shopping; we won't get in your way. But first, here's some information on how it all works. </p>

<h5>Step 1. Confirm Your Membership</h5> 

<p>USAA members save on average $3,335 off of MSRP when compared to non-members. </p>

<p>These savings and incentives are available only to USAA members, so be sure to have your membership number at the ready when it's time to visit the dealership. </p>

<h5>Step 2. Contact a Dealership</h5> 

<p>We value your privacy, and unlike most other car-buying services, we do not automatically send your contact information to the dealer. </p>

<p>You can control how dealers contact you from within your account, and dealer contact only happens when you initiate it.</p>

<h5>Step 3. Redeem Your Offer</h5> 

<p>Once you make contact with a dealership, your offer details— attached to your USAA membership account—will be sent to your email address for safekeeping. </p>

<p>Be sure to print this out and bring it to the dealership with you to ensure you get your savings.</p>

<p>That's all for now, happy car shopping. </p>

<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>USAA</p>
