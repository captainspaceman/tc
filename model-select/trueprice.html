<h1>The TruePrice Difference</h1>

<h3>A Real Price</h3>

<p>Pricing uncertainty is a thing of the past. You choose your car and get the actual price&mdash;including fees, incentives and accessories.</p>

<h3>Competitively Discounted</h3>

<p>See the discount, get the discount. Certified Dealers on TrueCar are looking to sell, not to negotiate. You get the price you will pay at the dealership, no questions asked.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Backed by Market Data&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Every vehicle has its own price curve. Know what people in your neighborhood paid, and compare your TruePrice to their price&mdash;a car market you actually can see.&nbsp;</p>
